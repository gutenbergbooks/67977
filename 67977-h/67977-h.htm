<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> kitchen door stood open wide, and the breath
from the meadow blew freshly across Joyce Radway&#8217;s
hot cheeks and forehead as she passed hurriedly back
and forth from the kitchen stove to the diningroom
table preparing the evening meal.</p>

<p>It had been a long, hard day and she was very tired.
The tears seemed to have been scorching her eyelids since
early morning, and because her spirit would not let them
out they seemed to have been flowing back into her heart
till its beating was almost stopped by the deluge. Somehow
it had been the hardest day in all the two weeks since
her aunt died; the culmination of all the hard times since
Aunt Mary had been taken sick and her son Eugene Massey
brought his wife and two children home to live.</p>

<p>To begin with, at the breakfast table Eugene had
snarled at Joyce for keeping her light burning so long the
night before. He told her he couldn&#8217;t afford to pay electric
bills for her to sit up and read novels. This was
most unjust since he knew that Joyce never had any novels
to read, but that she was studying for an examination
which would finish her last year of normal school work
and fit her for a teacher. But then her cousin was seldom
just. He took especial delight in tormenting her. Sometimes
it seemed incredible that he could possibly be Aunt
Mary&#8217;s son, he was so utterly unlike her in every way.
But he resembled markedly the framed picture of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
father Hiram Massey, which hung in the parlor, whom
Joyce could but dimly remember as an uncle who never
smiled at her.</p>

<p>She had controlled the tears then that sprang to her
eyes and tried to answer in a steady voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Gene, I was studying, I wasn&#8217;t reading
a novel. You know last night was the last chance I had
to study. The examination is today. Maybe when I get
a school I&#8217;ll be able to pay those electric light bills and
some other things too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; said Eugene discourteously, &#8220;You&#8217;ll pay
them a big lot, won&#8217;t you? That&#8217;s all poppy-cock, your
trying to get a school, after a whole year out of school
yourself. Much chance you&#8217;ll stand! And you may as
well understand right now that I&#8217;m not going to undertake
the expense of you lying around here idling and pretending
to go to school for another whole year, so you better
begin to make other plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce swallowed hard and tried to smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said pleasantly, &#8220;Wait till after the examinations.
I may pass and then there won&#8217;t be any more
trouble about it. The mathematics test is this morning.
If I pass that I&#8217;m not in the least afraid of the rest. It
is all clear sailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; broke in Nannette&#8217;s voice sharply,
&#8220;Are you expecting to go off this morning? Because if
you are you&#8217;ve missed your calculation. I have an appointment
with the dressmaker in town this morning and I
don&#8217;t intend to miss it. She&#8217;s promised to get my new
dress done by the day after tomorrow, and you&#8217;ll have
to stay home and see that the children get their lunch and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
get back to school. Besides, it&#8217;s time the cellar was
cleaned and you&#8217;d better get right at it. I thought I heard
a rat down there last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce looked up aghast:</p>

<p>&#8220;But Nan! You&#8217;ve known all along I must go to the
school house this morning early!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t &#8216;but-Nan&#8217; me, young lady, you&#8217;re not
in a position to say &#8216;must&#8217; to any one in this house. If
mother chose to let you act the independent lady that was
her affair, but she&#8217;s not here now, and you&#8217;re a dependent.
It&#8217;s time you realized that. I say I&#8217;m going to town this
morning, and you&#8217;ll have to stay at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette had sailed off upstairs with the parting
words and Eugene went on reading his paper as if he
had not heard the altercation. For a moment Joyce contemplated
an appeal to him but one glance at the forbidding
eyebrows over the top of the morning paper made her
change her mind. There was little hope to be had from
an appeal to him. He had never liked her and she had
never liked him. It dated back to the time when she
caught him deceiving his mother and he dared her to
tell on him. She had not told, it had not seemed a matter
that made it necessary, but he hated her for knowing he
was not all that his mother thought him. Besides, he
was much older than she, and had a bullying nature. Her
clear, young eyes annoyed him. She represented conscience
in the concrete, his personal part of which he had
long ago throttled. He did not like to be reminded of
conscience, and too, he had always been jealous of his
mother&#8217;s love for Joyce.</p>

<p>Joyce glanced with troubled eyes at the clock.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>She was due at the school house at nine-thirty. Gene
would take the eight-nineteen train to town, and Nan would
likely go with him. There would be time after they left
to put up a lunch for the children if she hurried. Nan
didn&#8217;t like them to take their lunch, but Nan would have
to stand it this time, for she meant to take that examination.
She shut her lips tightly and began to remove the
breakfast things from the table swiftly and quietly, leaving
a plate for Junior who would be sure to be down late.</p>

<p>Her mind was stinging with the insults that had been
flung at her. She had always known that she and her
cousins were not compatible but such open words of affront
had never been given her before, although the last few
days since the funeral there had been glances and tones
of contempt that hurt her. She had tried to be patient,
hoping soon to be in a position where she would not
longer be dependent upon her relatives.</p>

<p>There was some wrangling between Junior and his
sister before Nan and Gene left for the train, and Joyce
had been obliged to leave her work to settle the dispute;
and again after they were gone she had to stop spreading
the bread for the lunches and hunt for Junior&#8217;s cap and
Dorothea&#8217;s arithmetic. It was a breathless time at the
end, getting the lunches packed and the children off to
school. She met with no opposition from them about
taking their lunches for they loved to do it, but they insisted
on two slices apiece of jelly roll which so reduced
the amount left in the cake box that Joyce added &#8220;jelly
roll&#8221; to the numerous things she must do when she got
back from her examination.</p>

<p>But at last she saw them run off together down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
street and she was free to rush to her room, smooth her
hair, and slip into her dark blue serge. It remained to be
seen how much time there would be left for the cellar
when she got home. But whatever came she must get
those examinations done.</p>

<p>When she was half way downstairs she ran back
and picked up a few little treasured trinkets from her
upper bureau drawer sweeping them into her bag, some
things that Aunt Mary had given her, a bit of real lace,
some Christmas handkerchiefs, one or two pieces of
jewelry, things that she prized and did not want handled
over. Both Dorothea and her mother seemed to consider
they had a perfect right to rummage in her bureau drawers
and the day before Joyce had come upon Nan just emerging
from her clothespress door as if she had been looking
things over there.</p>

<p>It was not that the girl had anything of much value,
but there were a few little things that seemed sacred to
her because of their association, and she could not bear
to have them handled over contemptuously by her cousin.
Nan might return sooner than she expected and would
be sure to come to her room to look for her. It would
only anger her if she found the door locked, and anyhow
the spare room key fitted her lock also. There was no
privacy to be had in the house since Aunt Mary&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>Joyce closed and locked the house carefully, placing
the key in its usual place of hiding at the top of the porch
pillar under the honeysuckle vine, and hurried down the
street toward the school building. She registered a deep
hope that she might get home in time to do a good deal
of work in the cellar before Nan arrived but she meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to try to forget cellar and Nan and everything till her examinations
were over.</p>

<p>At the school house she found to her dismay that the
schedule had been changed and that three of her tests
came successively that day. There would be no chance
of getting through before half past three, perhaps later.
Nan would be angry, but it could not be helped for this
once. She would try and forget her until she was through
and then hurry home. She resolved not to answer back
nor get angry that night if anything mean was said to
her, and perhaps things would calm down. So she put
her mind on logarithms, Latin conjugations and English
poetry. These examinations offered the only way she
knew to independence and it must be taken.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon she hurried home, tired, faint,
worried lest she had not answered some of the questions
aright, palpitating with anxiety lest Nan had preceded
her, or the children were running riot.</p>

<p>Breathlessly she came in sight of the house, and saw
the front door open wide and the doctor&#8217;s car standing
in the drive. She ran up the steps in fright and apprehension.</p>

<p>Nan was very much home indeed, and was furious!
She met Joyce in the hall and greeted her with a tirade.
Junior had been hurt playing baseball and had been
brought home with a bandaged head and arm, weeping
loudly.</p>

<p>Dorothea lolled on the stairs blandly eating the remainder
of the jelly roll and eyeing her cousin with contempt
and wicked exultation. She had already lighted the
fuse by saying that she and Junior hadn&#8217;t wanted to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
their lunch, but Cousin Joyce had insisted, and had given
them <i>all</i> the jelly roll. The light in her mother&#8217;s eye had
been such as to make Dorothea linger near at the right
time. Dorothea loved being on the virtuous outside of
a fight. If one showed signs of dying she knew how
to ask the right question or say the innocent word to
revive it once more. Dorothea contemplated Joyce now
with deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s car was scarcely out of the gate and
down the road before the storm broke once more upon
Joyce&#8217;s tired head.</p>

<p>Joyce did not wait to go upstairs to her room and
change her dress. She took off her hat on the way to
the kitchen and put it and her bag and books and papers
on the little bench outside the kitchen door where no
one would be likely to notice them. She enveloped herself
in a big kitchen apron and went to work, preparing
the vegetables for dinner and getting out materials for
jelly roll. Then Nan entered, blue blazes in her eye.</p>

<p>Nan had not taken off her hat yet and around her
neck she was wearing Joyce&#8217;s pretty gray fox neckpiece,
Aunt Mary&#8217;s last Christmas gift, which Joyce had supposed
was safely put away in camphor on her closet shelf.
Joyce had not noticed it in the darkness of the hall, but
now the indignity struck her in the face like a blow as
Nan stood out in the open doorway smartly gowned and
powdered and rouged just a bit, her face angry and
haughty, her air imperious:</p>

<p>&#8220;You ungrateful, wicked girl!&#8221; broke forth Nan.
&#8220;You might just as well have been a murderer! Suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Junior had been brought home dying and no one to
open the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Nan,&#8221; began Joyce, &#8220;I did not expect
to be gone so long. I was told there would be only one
examination today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Examinations! Don&#8217;t talk to me about examinations!
That&#8217;s all you care about! It&#8217;s nothing to you that the
little child who has lived under the same roof with you
for three years is seriously hurt. It&#8217;s nothing to you even
if he had been killed. And he might have been killed,
<i>easily</i>! Yes, he might, you wicked girl! It was at noon
he was playing ball when he got hit, and you knew I didn&#8217;t
want him to stay at school at noontime just for that reason.
The bad boys tried to hurt him,&#8221; so she raved on,
&#8220;It was your fault. Entirely your fault!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was absolutely no use in trying to say anything
in reply. Nannette would not let her. Whenever she
opened her lips to say she was sorry her cousin screamed
the louder, till Joyce finally closed her lips and went about
her work with white, set face, wishing somehow she might
get away from this awful earth for a little while, wondering
what would be the outcome of all this when Gene
got home. Gene was not very careful himself about Junior.
He spoiled him horribly, but he was very keen about
defending him always. As she went about her kitchen
work she tried to think what she could say or do that
would still the tempest. It seemed to her that her heart
was bursting with the trouble. Maybe she ought to have
given up the examination after all. Maybe she should
have stayed at home. But that would have meant everlasting
dependence upon those to whom she was not closely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
bound. And Junior had already recovered sufficiently to
be out in his bandages swinging on the gate. He could
not be seriously injured. Oh, why could she not have
died instead of Aunt Mary! Why did people have to
bring children into the world and then leave them to fend
for themselves where they were not wanted? What was
life all for anyway?</p>

<p>Dorothea hovered around like a hissing wasp, filching
the apples as they were peeled and quartered for the apple
sauce, sticking a much soiled finger into the cake batter,
licking it, and applying it again to the batter several times,
in spite of Joyce&#8217;s protests. She seemed to know that her
mother would not reprove her for anything she did to
annoy Joyce tonight.</p>

<p>Gene came in while Joyce was taking up the dinner,
and Joyce could hear his wife telling in a high suppressed
key all the wrongs of the day, with her own garbled account
of Junior&#8217;s accident and Joyce&#8217;s disregard of orders.
So the tears stung into her eyes and her hot cheeks flushed
warmer and the only thing in the world that gave her
any comfort was the sweet spring breath from the meadow
coming in the kitchen door as she passed and repassed, carrying
dishes of potatoes and cabbage and fried pork
chops. Their mingled hot odors smothered her as they
steamed up into her face, and then would come that sweet,
cool breeze, blowing them aside, laying a cool hand on
her wet brow like the hand of a gentle mother. How
she longed to fly away into the coolness and sweetness and
leave it all behind. How many times during the last two
hard weeks had she looked out that kitchen door across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the meadows and longed to be walking across them into
the world away from it all forever.</p>

<p>Gene came into the diningroom just as she set the
hot coffee-pot down on the table, and he looked at her
with his cold blue eyes, a look that was like a long, thin
blade of steel piercing to her very soul. She thought she
had never before seen such a look of contempt and hate.
She felt as if it were something tangible that he had
inserted into her soul which she would never be able to
get out again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a pretty one, aren&#8217;t you? Mother was
always boasting about how dependable you were, I wonder
what she would think of you now! I always knew you
had it in you. You&#8217;re just like your contemptible father!
Get an idea in your head and have to carry it out. Bull-headed.
That&#8217;s what you are. That&#8217;s what he was. I
remember hearing all about it. He wanted to study up
some germ and make himself famous. Had to go and
get into some awful disease, subject himself to danger,
and finally got the disease and died. Pretended he was
doing a great thing for humanity at large, but left his
wife and child for her poor sister to support and saddled
us all with a girl just like him to house and feed and
clothe. Now, young lady, I want you to understand from
this time forth that we&#8217;re done with nonsense and whether
you pass or whether you don&#8217;t pass, your place is <i>right
here in this house doing the work</i> and <i>taking the orders
from my wife</i>! I&#8217;ve got you to look after and I&#8217;ll do it,
but I don&#8217;t intend to stand any more of your monkey-shines.
Do you hear? <i>I won&#8217;t have</i> anybody in my house
<i>that doesn&#8217;t obey me</i>!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Joyce looked at him in a kind of tired wonder. She
knew there were things being said that were dissecting
her very soul, and that by and by when she moved she
would bleed, perhaps her soul might bleed to death with
the sharpness of it all, but just now she had not the
strength to resent, to say anything to refute the awful
half-truths he was speaking, to shout out as she felt she
ought, that he had no right to speak that way about her
dear, dead father whom she had not known much, could
scarcely remember, but had been taught by both mother
and aunt to love dearly. She could only stand and stare
at him as he talked. She was growing white to the lips.
Her knees were shaking under her, and the children stared
at her curiously, even Nannette eyed her strangely. She
was summoning all her strength for an effort:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Eugene,&#8221; she said clearly as if she were
talking to some one away off, and her voice steadied as
she went on. &#8220;You know I don&#8217;t have to stay here if you
feel this way. I will go!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, like a bird that suddenly sees an opening
in its cage and sets its wings swiftly, she turned and
walked out of the room, across the kitchen, and out the
kitchen door into the evening sunlight and the sweet
meadow breath.</p>

<p>On the bench beside the door lay her hat covering her
little worn handbag and books and papers. She swept
them all up as she passed, and held them in front of her
as she walked steadily on down the pebbled path among
the new grass toward the garage, the blinding tears now
coming and blurring every thing before her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Let her alone!&#8221; she heard Gene sneer loudly, &#8220;She&#8217;ll
go out to the garage and boo-hoo awhile and then she&#8217;ll
come back and behave herself. Dishes? I should say
not! Don&#8217;t you do a dish! Let her do &#8217;em when she
gets over her fit. It&#8217;ll do her good. She&#8217;ll be of some
use to you after this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce swept away the tears with a quick hand and
lifted her head. Why should she weep when she was
walking away from this? She had wanted to go, had
wondered and wished for an opening, and now it had
come, why be sad? She was walking away into the beauty
of the sunset. Smell the air! She drew a deep breath
and went straight on past the garage, down through the
garden to the fence, and stooping slipped between the bars
and into the meadow.</p>

<p>There were violets blooming among the grass here,
blue as the sky, and nodding to her, dazzling in their
blueness. There was a dandelion. How bright its gold!
The world was before her. The examination was not
over. But what of that? She could not go back to take
her diploma anyway, but she was free, and God would
take care of her somewhere, somehow.</p>

<p>A sense of buoyancy bore her up. Her feet touched
the grass of the meadow as if it had been full of springs.
She lost the consciousness of her great weariness. Her
soul had found wings. She was walking into a crimson
path of the sunset, and April was in her lungs. How
good to be away from the smell of pork chops and hot
cabbage, the steam of potatoes and Gene Massey&#8217;s voice.
Never, never would she go back. Not for all the things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
she had left behind. They were few. She was glad she
had her few little trinkets. They were all that mattered
anyway. Except the fur neckpiece. It went hard to
lose that. The last thing Aunt Mary bought her. Of
course it would have been wiser to wait to pack. There
were her two good gingham dresses, and two others that
were faded, but she would need things to work in, and
there was the little pink Georgette that Aunt Mary bought
her last summer! She hated to lose that. But Aunt Mary,
if she could see would quite understand, and if she could
not see it could all be explained in heaven some day.
There would be no use sending to Nannette or Gene for
anything. They would never send her a rag that belonged
to her. There would be inconveniences of course, her hair-brush,
her tooth brush&mdash;but what were they?</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly as she climbed the fence, and
stood in a long, white road winding away over a hill, the
sun which had been slipping, slipping down lower and
lower, went out of sight and left only a ruby light behind,
and all about the world looked gray. The sweet smells
were there, and the wonderful cool air to touch her brow
lightly like that hand of her mother so long ago, just
as it touched and called her in the kitchen a few minutes
before, but the bright world was growing quiet at the approaching
night, and suddenly Joyce began to wonder
where she was going.</p>

<p>Automobiles were coming and going hurriedly as if
the people in them were going home to dinner, and they
smiled and talked joyously as they passed her, and looked
at her casually, a girl walking alone in the twilight with
her hat in her hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Joyce came to herself and put on her hat, she put her
papers together in a book, and the books under her arm,
and slipped the strap of her handbag over her wrist.
She went on walking down the road toward the pink and
gold of the sunset and wondered where she was going,
and then, as she lifted her eyes she saw a star slip faintly
out in the clear space between the ruby and rose, as if to
remind her that One above was watching and had not
forgotten her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Back</span> in the kitchen she had left silence reigned, and
all the pans and kettles and bowls which had been used
in preparing the hurried evening meal seemed to fill the
place with desolation. It was not a room that Nannette
cared to contemplate as she came out to get the coffee-pot
for Eugene&#8217;s second cup which he insisted be kept hot.
She frowned at the jelly roll all powdered with sugar
and lying neatly on a small platter awaiting dessert time.
It was incredible that Joyce had managed to make it in
so short a time with all the rest she had to do, but she
needn&#8217;t think she could make up for negligence and disobedience
by her smartness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gene, I think you better go down to the garage and
talk to her,&#8221; said Nannette coming back with coffee, &#8220;The
kitchen&#8217;s in an awful mess and she ought to get at it at
once. I certainly don&#8217;t feel like doing her work for
her when I&#8217;ve been in the city all day, and then this
shock about Junior on top of it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her good and alone,&#8221; said Gene sourly, &#8220;She&#8217;s
nothing to kick about. If I go out there and pet her up
she&#8217;ll expect it every time. That&#8217;s the way mother spoiled
her, let her do every thing she took a notion to, and she
has to learn at the start that things are different. What
made her mad anyhow? She&#8217;s never had a habit of flying
up. I didn&#8217;t think she had the nerve to walk off like that,
she&#8217;s always been so meek and self-righteous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose she didn&#8217;t like it because I wore that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
precious fox scarf of hers to the city. She&#8217;s terribly afraid
her things will get hurt, and she pretends to think a lot
of it because mother gave it to her last Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you wear her fur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly. Why shouldn&#8217;t I? It&#8217;s no kind
of a thing for a young girl like her to have, especially in
her position. She ought to be glad she has something I
can use that will make up for what we do for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better let her things alone, Nan. It might make
trouble for us if she gets up the nerve to fight. You can&#8217;t
tell how mother left things you know, till Judge Peterson
gets well and we hear the will read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Didn&#8217;t your mother leave everything
to you, I should like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t be sure about it yet. I suppose she
did, but it&#8217;s just as well to know where we stand exactly
before we make any offensive moves. You know mother
said something that last night about Joyce always having
a right to stay here, that it was her home. I didn&#8217;t think
much of it at the time of course, and told her we would
consider it our duty to look out for Joyce till she got
married of course, but I&#8217;ve been thinking since, you can&#8217;t
just tell, mother might have been trying to prepare me
for some surprise the will is going to spring on us. You
know mother had an overdeveloped conscience, and there
was something about a trifling sum of money that Joyce&#8217;s
father left that mother put into this house to make a
small payment I think. I can&#8217;t just remember what it
was but that would be just enough to make mother
think she ought to give everything she owned to Joyce.
I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be surprised at almost anything after the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
she made a fool of that girl. But anyhow, you let her
alone till she gets good and ready to come in. She won&#8217;t
dare stay out all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She might go to the neighbors and make a lot of
talk about us,&#8221; suggested Nan, &#8220;She knows she&#8217;d have
us in a hole if she did that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t go to the neighbors, not if I know her
at all. She wouldn&#8217;t think it was right. She has that
kind of a conscience too. It&#8217;s lucky for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, suppose she doesn&#8217;t come in and wash the
dishes tonight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em go then till tomorrow. You&#8217;ve got dishes
enough for breakfast haven&#8217;t you? Well, just leave everything
where it is. Don&#8217;t even clear off the table. Just
let her see that she&#8217;ll have it all to do when she gets over
her tantrums, and you won&#8217;t find her cutting up again
very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she&#8217;ll have to come back tonight,&#8221; speculated
Nan. &#8220;She has another examination tomorrow
morning I think, and it would take an earthquake or something
like that to keep her away from that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll order an earthquake then. I don&#8217;t mean
to have her finish that examination. If she happens, to
pass&mdash;and she likely would for those Radways have brains
they say, that&#8217;s the trouble with them&mdash;she&#8217;ll make us all
kinds of trouble wanting to teach instead of doing the
work for you, and then we&#8217;d be up against it right away.
It costs like the dickens to get a servant these days and
there&#8217;s no sense in having an outsider around stealing
your food and wearing your clothes. Don&#8217;t you worry
about Joyce. Let her alone till she comes in. Lock the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
kitchen door so she&#8217;ll have to knock. Then I&#8217;ll let her
in and give her such a dressing down as she&#8217;ll remember
for a few years. Come on. Let&#8217;s turn out this diningroom
light and go into the living room. Then she&#8217;ll know
we&#8217;re not going to wash those dishes, and she&#8217;ll come
in all the sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette slapped Dorothea for breaking off another
piece from the jelly roll, and turned out the light quickly.
It occurred to her that there would be nobody to make
another jelly roll when this one was gone unless Joyce
came speedily back. She hated cooking.</p>

<p>But although she intentionally neglected to lock the
kitchen door, hoping the girl would slip in quietly when
they were gone from the diningroom and get the work
done, Joyce did not return. Dorothea and Junior were
allowed to sit up far beyond their usual bedtime, and after
they were at last quiet upstairs, Eugene and Nannette
continued to sit and read, loth to leave until their young
victim should return repentant and they could tell her
just what they thought of her for her base ingratitude.
When you know you have done wrong yourself there is
nothing so soothing as to be able to scold some one else.</p>

<p>When Nannette finally went upstairs to bed she took
the borrowed fox fur and flung it across Joyce&#8217;s bed,
with its tail dragging on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know why we can&#8217;t have that will
read without waiting for that old mummy to get well,&#8221;
she said discontentedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s awfully awkward waiting
this way and not knowing what is ours. Why can&#8217;t some
one else read it if Judge Peterson isn&#8217;t able to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no one knows just where it is. His valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
papers are all locked in his safe, and the doctor won&#8217;t
let him be asked a thing about business till he gets able
to be around. He says it might throw him all back to
have to think about anything now. Of course it&#8217;s all
nonsense, but I don&#8217;t see what we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he should die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then of course, they would open his safe and
examine all his papers, but his wife won&#8217;t hear to anything
being touched till he gets out of danger, so we just have
to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to worry about it,&#8221; said
Nannette with a toss of her head. &#8220;If the will isn&#8217;t right
we&#8217;ll just break it, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m not going to let that
girl get in the way of my happiness. There&#8217;s more than
one way of going about things, and, as you say, she has
that kind of a conscience. If that&#8217;s her weak point we&#8217;ll
work her through that. If she thinks her beloved Aunt
Mary is going to be proved in court as not of sound mind,
she&#8217;ll give up the hair on her head. I know her. Smug-faced
little fanatic! How on earth did she ever get wished
on your mother for life anyway? You&#8217;ve never told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, her mother was mother&#8217;s youngest sister, and
idol. Mother was perfectly insane about her. Then she
married this Radway, and everybody said it was a great
match, brilliant young doctor and all that. But the brilliant
young doctor showed he hadn&#8217;t a grain of sense
in his head. He discovered some new germ or other and
then he went to work experimenting on it, and two or
three times was saved from death just by the skin of
his teeth. Finally he let them inoculate him with the thing,
just to observe its workings. He knew he was running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
a great risk when he did it, and yet he was ass enough to
go ahead. When he died they sold the house and a good
deal of the furnishings. Mother had some of the things
up in the attic a long time. I don&#8217;t know what became
of them. Sold I suppose, perhaps to get that fox fur.
Mother was just daffy on that girl. She always wanted
a daughter you know. And after Aunt Helen died,&mdash;she
didn&#8217;t live many months after her husband, just faded
away you know&mdash;why mother did everything for Joyce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think she did more than she had any right to
do for just a niece,&#8221; said Nannette scornfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s time
you had your innings. I think your mother should have
thought of her own son and her grandchildren, and not
lavished fox furs on a mere relation. She just spoiled
Joyce. She thinks she has to live in luxury, and it&#8217;s going
to be very hard to break her in to working for her living.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clock was striking twelve before Nannette began
to undress, and now and then she would cast an anxious eye
out of the window and wonder how long the erring girl&#8217;s
nerve would hold out, or whether she had really dared
go to some neighbor&#8217;s and stay all night. If she had
what could they do?</p>

<p>Finally Gene got up from his reading chair and went
downstairs to see if all the doors were locked, he said; but
in reality he went softly out the kitchen door and walked
down to the garage with slow, careful tread, stopping to
listen, every minute or two. But no sound reached his
ear save the dreamy notes of a tree toad. The little gray
clouds drifting through the sky were hiding the moon
and making the back yard quite dark. Somehow a vision
of his mother&#8217;s face came to him, that last day when she
had called him to the bed side and reminded him that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
left Joyce as a sacred trust to his care. She told him that
of course he would understand the home was always hers
and something like reproach came and stood before his
self-centred, satisfied soul and gave him strange uneasiness.</p>

<p>He stepped quietly into the garage and looked around
in the darkness. There was no car as yet, but he meant
to purchase one the minute the estate was settled up.
He felt sure there would be plenty of money to do a number
of the things to the house that he had already planned.
It was not really a garage, though he had called it that
ever since he came home to live with his mother, it was
only the old barn with a new door.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of any Joyce inside the old
barn, though he searched every corner and even opened
the door of what used to be the harness closet.</p>

<p>He closed the door and went outside, puzzled, a trifle
anxious, not for the safety of the girl whom he had
driven from the only home she had by his unsympathetic
words, but for the possibility of what she might have said
to some neighbor with whom she might have taken refuge
for the night. And yet he could not bring himself to
believe, that Joyce would be so disloyal to his mother&#8217;s
family as to let others know of a rupture between them.</p>

<p>He went outside and walked around, but there was
no sign of any one, and the dew glistened evenly on
the new grass in the sudden light as the moon swept out
from behind a cloud and poured down a moment&#8217;s radiance.
There were no marks of footprints on the tender
grass anywhere near the building.</p>

<p>Standing in the shadow of the big maple half way to
the house he called: &#8220;Joyce!&#8221; once, sharply, curtly, in a
tone that startled himself and shocked the tree toads into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
sudden brief silence, but the echo of the meadow came in
sweet drifts of violet breath as his only answer. His voice
sounded gruff even to himself and he realized that she
would not come to a call like that. If she had strength
of purpose enough to go at his harsh words she would
not come at such a call. He tried again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce!&#8221; and Joyce would have been astonished could
she have heard his voice. He had never spoken to her
with as much kindliness of tone in all his life, not even
when he wanted to borrow money of her. Yes, he had
really descended to asking her who had but a small allowance
from the bounty of his mother, to loan it to him.
And she had always been ready to lend graciously if it
was not already promised for some necessity. He would
soon have kept her in bankruptcy had not his mother discovered
it and forbidden Joyce to lend any more, telling
her son to come to her in any need.</p>

<p>He stood there sometime calling into the darkness trying
various tones and wondering at himself, growing more
indignant with the girl for not answering, calling her
stubborn, and finally growing alarmed, although he would
not own it really to himself.</p>

<p>But at last he gave it up and went in, putting it aside
carelessly as if it were but a trifle after all. The girl was
stubborn but she would have to come back pretty soon,
and the lesson would only do her good. As for the neighbors,
they must prepare a story that would offset anything
she might tell them. And what did the neighbors matter
anyway? This wasn&#8217;t the only place in the world. They
could sell the house and move where Joyce had no friends,
then there would be no trouble. Joyce would have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
stick to them, for she had no way of earning money anywhere
else. The idea of teaching school was fool nonsense.
He wouldn&#8217;t think of allowing it. She would always
be taking on airs even if she paid board, and then
they would get no work out of her, and she would not
be pleasant to have around.</p>

<p>With this reflection he fell asleep, convinced that Joyce
would be found safe and sound and sane on the doorstep
in the morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About this time the new young superintendent of the
high school who was taking the place of the regular superintendent
while he was abroad for six months studying,
settled down in his one comfortable chair in his boarding
house room with a bundle of examination papers to
look over. This was not his work, but the two teachers
who would ordinarily have done it were both temporarily
disabled, one down with the grip and the other away at
a funeral, and since the averages must be ready before
commencement he had volunteered to mark these papers.</p>

<p>It was late and he was tired, for there had been a special
meeting of the school board to deal with a matter
connected with the new addition to the school building,
and also to arrange to supply the place of a teacher who
had suddenly decided to get married instead of continuing
to teach. There had been much discussion about both
matters and he had been greatly annoyed at the prospect of
one young woman who had been suggested to fill the vacancy.
She was of the so-called flapper variety and seemed
to him to have no idea of serious work. She had been in
his classes for the last six weeks, and he became more disgusted
with her every time he saw her. The idea of her as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
a colleague was not pleasant. He settled to his papers with
a frown that portended no good to the poor victims whose
fate he was settling by the marks of his blue pencil.</p>

<p>He marched through the papers, paragraph after paragraph,
question after question, marking them ruthlessly.
Misspelled words, how they got on his nerves! He drew
sharp blue lines like little swords through them, and wrote
caustic foot-notes on the corners of the pages. The young
aspirants for graduation who received them in the morning
would quiver when they read them and gather in
groups to cast anathemas at him.</p>

<p>But suddenly he came to a paper written in a clear,
firm hand as if the owner knew what she was talking about
and thought it really worth writing down. The first sentence
caught his interest because of the original way in
which the statement was made. Here was a young philosopher
who had really thought about life, and was taking
the examination as something of interest in itself, rather
than a terrible ordeal that must be gone through with
for future advantage. As he read a vision of a clear
smooth brow, calm eyes lifted now and then to the blackboard,
gradually came back to his memory. He was sure
this was the quiet young woman with the beautiful, sincere,
unselfish face that he had noticed as he passed through the
study hall that morning. There had been half a dozen
strangers in from neighboring towns for examination.
Only this one had attracted him. He had paused in the
doorway watching her a moment while he waited for a
book which the attending teacher was finding for him,
and had marked the quiet grace of her demeanor, the earnest
expression of her face, the pure regular features, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
soft outline of the brown waves of hair, the sweet,
old-fashionedness of her, and wondered who she was. He
had not been long in the town and did not know all
the village maidens, yet it seemed as if she must be from
another place, for certainly he could not have been in the
same town with this girl and not have marked her sooner
somewhere in either church or shop or street?
The busy day had surged in and he had forgotten the
face and thought no more of the girl. But now it all came
back with conviction as he read on. He turned to the end
of the paper for the name &#8220;Joyce Radway.&#8221; Somehow
it seemed to fit her, and he read on with new interest,
noting how she gave interest to the hackneyed themes that
had become monotonous through reading over and over
the crude, young answers to the same questions. How
was it that this young girl was able to give a turn to her
sentences that seemed to make any subject a thrilling,
throbbing, vital thing? And she did not skim over the
answers with the least possible information. She wrote
as if she liked to tell what she knew, as if her soul were
<i>en rapport</i> with her work, and as if she were writing it
for the mere joy of imparting the fact and its thrill
to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s a girl that would make a teacher all
right,&#8221; he said aloud to himself as he finished the paper
writing a clear blue &#8220;Excellent&#8221; upon it with his finest
flourish, &#8220;I wonder who she is? If she&#8217;s the one I saw
I&#8217;ll vote for her. I must inquire the first thing in the
morning. Joyce Radway. What a good name. It fits.
She&#8217;s the assistant I&#8217;d like if I have my way, unless I&#8217;m
very much mistaken in a human face.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> had walked a long way on a long gray ribbon
of road before it wound up hill and she began to realize
where her steps were turning. Up there on the top was
the dark outline of the old Hill Church, its spire a black
dart against the luminous night sky. A fitful moon
gleamed palely and showed it for a moment, still and gray
like a little lone dove asleep, and about it clustered the white
stones of the graveyard on the side of the hill sloping
down toward the valley. One tall shaft showed where
lay the dust of the rich, old, good man who gave the land
and built the church, and others less pretentious flocked
close at hand, a little social clique of the select dead who
had clung to the old church through the years of their
life, who there had been christened, married and buried.</p>

<p>With a catch in her breath like a sob Joyce hurried on,
realizing that it was here her heart was longing to go,
where she had left all that was mortal of her precious
Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>It was not that she had any feeling that the spirit she
loved was lingering there near its worn out earthly habitation,
it was only that the earth seemed so alien and she
so alone that it did her good to creep away to the quiet
mound that some kind neighbor had already made velvety
with close shaved turf.</p>

<p>She felt her way to the place, close beside the mound
where her mother had been laid. They had always kept
it neat and carefully tended when her aunt was alive, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
now she sank down between the two graves with her
hands spread broodingly, anguishingly over the tender
grass, and her face dropped down on its coolness.
How long she lay there she did not know. The hot
tears flowed relievingly down her cheeks and fell into
the cool grass, and overhead the quiet sky, with the single
star in a clearing among the floating clouds, and now
and then the serene, busy moon above it all, quite as if the
world was going as it should even though hearts were
being broken.</p>

<p>A sense of peace stole gradually upon her, and the
ache drifted out of her weary limbs, and out of her lonely
heart. It was almost as if some comfort had stolen upon
her from the quiet grass, and the busy, serene heaven
above. She did not feel afraid. She had no sense of the
presence of her aunt, only a deep, sweet understanding
that this little spot was sacred and here she might think
entirely unmolested.</p>

<p>It might be that she slept for a space, for she was
very weary and the day had been so hard, but she was
not sure. Rather it was as if she were just resting, as she
used to rest in her mother&#8217;s arms and be rocked, long
ago, the first thing she could remember. The sense of
her troubles, and her terrible situation had slipped away
from her. She was just resting, not thinking. When suddenly
the sound of voices&mdash;voices quite near, broke upon
her, as if they had suddenly rounded the hill and were
close at hand, coming on. Cautious voices, albeit, with a
carrying sibilant, and something familiar about one of
them. She could not tell why they struck terror to her
soul, nor at what instant she realized that they were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
just foot travellers going on by, but were coming toward
her. She found herself trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out there, Kid,&#8221; said the familiar voice, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
skid over that poor stiff. Those headstones aren&#8217;t easy
to play with and we can&#8217;t afford to lose any of this catch.
Its worth it&#8217;s weight in gold you know, rare antique! We
ought to make about four hundred bucks apiece out of
this lot if we place it wisely.&#8221;</p>

<p>The footsteps came on, and suddenly as the moon
swept out from the clouds for an instant she saw four
dark figures silhouetted against the lighter darkness of
the road, stealing slowly into the cemetery among the
graves carrying burdens between them, heavy, bulky,
shrouded burdens. The hurrying clouds obliterated everything
again, but she could hear the soft thud of their feet,
as they slowly felt their way. An occasional dart of light
from a pocket flash flickered fitfully on a headstone here
and there as she watched with bated breath. They seemed
to be coming straight toward her, and for an instant she
thought of trying to flee, but a great weakness overcame
her, so that she could hardly breathe, and it seemed impossible
to rise. Then the flashlight jabbed into her very
eyes, and she crouched against the sod and wished there
were some way to get down beneath it out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that, Kid?&#8221; the voice whispered. The
tiny flash fluttered here and there on the grass all about
her as she crouched. In a moment they would be upon
her. It seemed the culmination of all the terrible day.
Her heart throbbed painfully, while she waited a long
minute, hearing distinctly the oncoming feet swishing
softly in the grass, the labored breathing of those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
carried the heavy burden, the cautious whispers, and then,
could it be? They were only two graves away. They were
passing by. They were going toward the back part of
the cemetery.</p>

<p>She lay absolutely motionless listening for what seemed
hours. The soft thud of burdens laid down was followed
by the sound of a spade plunged deep in the earth, and
the ring of metal as it was drawn forth and hit against
a stone.</p>

<p>By and by she gained courage to open her eyes and
then to lift her head cautiously and glance about. Her
frightened heart almost stifled her with its wild beating.
The sky was luminous off to the east and against it
the five dark figures were darkly visible, three with shovels,
and one with a pick, the fifth watching, directing, occasionally
flashing a spot of light on a particular place. On the
ground a long line of something dark like a box or boxes.
Had they murdered some one and come to bury him in
the night, or were they grave robbers? She found herself
shuddering in the darkness, and when she put a trembling
hand to her brow it was cold and wet with perspiration.</p>

<p>She began to wonder if she dared to try and get away,
and measured the distance with her eye. The men seemed
so close when she considered making a move, especially the
one with the flashlight! Its merciless eye would be sure
to search her out if she attempted flight. Perhaps it would
be safer to lie still till they went away and trust that they
would go out by the same path they had entered and not
discover her. Yet when she tried to relax and wait she
was trembling so that it seemed as if the very cords that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
held her being together were loosed and she was slowly
becoming useless like Dorothea&#8217;s big bisque doll that lay
on a trunk in the attic with its head and arms lolling
at the end of emaciated rubber cords. She had a frightened
feeling that if she lay still very long she would become
unable ever to move again, the sensation that comes
in nightmare.</p>

<p>Then into her frenzied mind came the thought of
Eugene and Nannette and how triumphant they would be
if they knew she was going through this agony. They
would say it was good punishment for her behavior, a
just reward for her headstrong actions. Had she been
wrong in going away as she did? Had they been right
to insist on her giving up the examinations? Somehow
her conscience, hard pressed as she was, could not see that
they had a right to keep her from the only way she knew
of earning her living. Somehow she could not feel that
any law, either physical or moral laid any obligation upon
her to stay with the children when the mother had known
for three weeks of her coming examinations, and when
she often of her own accord let them take their lunch to
school if it happened to suit her own convenience. Junior
might have been hurt playing ball at recess as well as at
noon, and he always played ball at recess. No, her conscience
was clear on that score. She had a perfect right
to put herself in the way of not being dependent upon them
financially, and the school teaching was the only way she
knew to do it. Still, of course it was all over now. She
had gone away from any chance that might have come
to her through those examinations, gone out into space
alone without any goal or any plan. She might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
done that in the first place of course if she had known
they were going to act that way. Well it couldn&#8217;t be
helped now. She had gone and nothing would induce her
to go back. Perhaps when she found a home, if she found
a home, she might send back to find out the result of her
hard work. It might do her some good somewhere else.
But she was too tired now, and too frightened to think
about it.</p>

<p>She stole another glance toward the invaders. They
seemed to be arguing in whispers about something, gesticulating,
pointing. Perhaps she might manage to slip away
while they were absorbed without their notice. She made
a soft little move to sit up, and as she put out her arm
to steady herself the metal chain of her handbag clinked
just the faintest little bit against the iron pipe of the low
fence that surrounded the neighboring grave. Instantly
everything was silent among the group of men, the dark
figures as if they had been but shadows crouched out of
sight, only the alert head and shoulders of one showed
dimly against the luminous spot in the sky. She could
feel that their eyes were focused upon her as if they had
been spotlights out of the darkness. She did not dare
to move even to relax her fingers which had been stretched
to grasp the iron rail. Her breath was suspended midway,
and in the whole wide, peaceful acre the air seemed tense
as though the very dead were waiting with her for the
outcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God!&#8221; she prayed, &#8220;Oh, God! Help me now!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time since Aunt Mary&#8217;s death that she
felt herself to have really prayed. Somehow her heart
had seemed stunned since the funeral, and when she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the words of prayer with her lips there had been such
empty ache in her heart that they had not seemed to
mean anything. Now in her great need she had the distinct
realization of crying out to a God upon whom she
relied and whom her faith of the years had tested. And
just as distinctly she felt the surety that He was there.
He had answered.</p>

<p>It was as if that cry for help was a surrender, a committing
of her way to Him. As if she had said: &#8220;Here
am I. I am yours. However right or wrong I may have
been to have put myself into this situation I am here and
helpless. If I am worth anything at all to you save me
for I cannot save myself. I am giving my future into
your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course there was no such logical sequence of thought
or word in the swift flash of her appeal, but afterwards
she was aware it had been a commitment and a covenant.</p>

<p>As if an answer of assurance had come a calm came
upon her. Her breath moved on, her heart beat naturally.
The tensity of the air seemed gone. The dark shadows
by the pile of dirt stirred. A low murmur passed among
them. They moved and came upright again. Their eyes
ceased to pierce her like spot lights. They moved with
ease and took up their shovels. One even laughed in a
low, half nervous tone. Only one still stood and watched,
his attitude alert, not satisfied that the danger was passed.
He murmured a low warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw! What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; ye?&#8221; another replied jocularly.
&#8220;D&#8217;ye think the dead can walk? It&#8217;s just a wild
rabbit jumpin&#8217; amongst the gravel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wild rabbits aren&#8217;t metal shod,&#8221; said the familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
voice seeming to come from a face looking her way, and
she knew that one at least of the shadowy figures had not
ceased to watch and listen.</p>

<p>It seemed hours that she lay there holding her breath,
afraid to stir lest they come her way, yet feeling an impulse
within her to get away. For at any moment they
might come out and walk right in the path by her side.
They could not fail to see her if they passed that way.
Dear Aunt Mary lying so quietly beneath the sod! How
good that she was not really there herself, that she could
not know the peril she was in! Or was she perhaps near
in spirit? Did God ever let those who had gone to live
with Him come to guard and help those they had left behind?
But at least she was not worried, for in heaven
none could worry, being with the great God who knew
all, and whose power was over all. God would not really
let anything hurt her. She had cried for help and he
would eventually bring her out of all this into safety.</p>

<p>The assurance that came with these swift thoughts
made her calmer, and finally gave her courage to begin
slowly to move a hand and foot out toward the path. There
was a sound of soft thudding of the spade against the
turf as if it were being replaced over the excavation and
the men would soon be returning to the road. If she
would escape unseen it must be done at once.</p>

<p>Slowly, cautiously, she put out her hand and firmly
grasped the rail of the low fence surrounding the next
little lot. The cold iron steadied her, and she next moved
her foot with a motion so slow and cautious that there
was absolutely no sound from it. But it was a work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
time. Would the time hold out until she had removed
herself entirely from the line of their possible route?</p>

<p>After the other foot had changed its place somewhat
she was able to lift her whole body and move it over
several inches into the path without perceiving any sign
that she had been heard or seen. Pausing to take a deep
breath, and holding her body steady a few inches above
the ground she cautiously began to move forward. It
reminded her of those moving pictures of divers and tennis
players who by a slower manipulation of the machine
are made to perform their tricks in measured rhythm so
that every stage of the action can be observed. It meant
perfect control of every muscle of the body. It meant
deep breathing and a calm mind to perform the feat, and
sometimes the wild beating of her frightened heart made
her feel that she must just drop in the grass where she
was and give it up. Besides her whole body was trembling
with weariness and excitement of the long, hard day, and
her nerves were spent. Big tears welled into her eyes
and dropped into the grass but she was unaware of them.
Only her will kept her moving or held her back when
she would have jumped to her feet and run screaming from
the place; only her sense that God was near somewhere
and would help her, kept her mind steady enough to direct
her movements. And sometimes, as she moved inch by
inch away from the direct line of the men it seemed
so slow, so impossible that she could ever get away that
she almost fell down.</p>

<p>She had crawled thus on hands and knees some twenty
feet, and was just considering the wisdom of turning her
course a little farther to the left before striking toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
road, when suddenly she heard a low murmur among the
men and glancing back saw that they had shouldered their
implements and were about to start away.</p>

<p>Fear overcame her and made her forget caution, and
she lifted one hand with a sudden movement to hasten,
grasping the handbag tightly and once more the tinkling
chains, slipping from between her tired fingers, struck
against a headstone and gave forth a weird little sound.</p>

<p>Instantly there was silence for the space of about a
second, the four men frozen into attention. Then stealthily,
his body ducked low, one of them crouched and came
forward. Almost silently he came, but she knew he was
coming straight toward her. She was paralyzed with
fear. She felt she could not move another fraction of
an inch, could not any longer hold on to that cold, smooth
stone she had grasped, could not draw herself out of sight
behind a marble shaft that loomed benevolently close at
hand. Then the realization that in a moment more he
would be upon her gave strength to her weakness. Who
knew what desperate criminals these might be? Grave
robbers would not hesitate to dig a new grave and hide
a victim in it where no one would ever suspect. Whatever
they had been doing it was evident they did not wish it
known, and it would go hard with any one who might be
feared as an eavesdropper. The thought gave wings
to her feet as she stumbled up and flew away in the darkness
among the shadowy grave stones, out toward the road.</p>

<p>It seemed miles she darted among those stones, as noiselessly
as possibly, but blindly, for it was dark, so dark,
and the little spot of light chased her maddeningly, darting
ahead of her and flickering into her eyes from the side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
unexpectedly, causing her to change her course. She
was aware that the men had separated, and she seemed
to be encompassed from all sides. Once she stumbled and
fell across a grave with the myrtle brushing her face, and
the scent of crushed rose geranium in the air. Strange
that rose geranium should be identified in her mind at
such a time as this. It seemed like a sweet thought reminding
her of quiet home and love and peace. But she
grasped the mossy stone above her and pulled herself up
just in time to evade one of her pursuers; and lo, just at
her left was the open field separated only by a scraggy
hedge. She parted the shrubs and slipped between, thankful
that her dress was dark, and sped away over the stubbly
ground, only the impetus of her going keeping her
from falling at almost every step. It was almost as if
she were flying, as if she were upheld by unseen hands
and guided. And the hedge grew taller as she approached
the road, completely hiding her flight from those on the
other side. She was conscious of confused noises behind
her, but her own going was so rapid as to shut out any
accurate sound. So at last she gained the fence, crept
tremblingly beneath the lichen covered rails and tottered
to her feet only to be confronted by a tall, dark figure
looming in the road as if he had been waiting there for
her a long time.</p>

<p>She caught her breath and turned to fly, but her hands
were caught in a big, firm grasp like a vise, and a flashlight
blazed into her frightened eyes for an instant. She closed
the lids involuntarily and shrank away, with a dizzy
feeling that for the first time in her life she must be going
to faint.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> half past seven the next morning, Nannette
was going distractedly about the dishevelled kitchen attempting
to get a semblance of a breakfast for the irate
Eugene and at the same time deal with her two unruly
children who half dressed were contending about the cat.</p>

<p>The telephone suddenly rang out sharply and Eugene
dropped the morning paper with a snap and sprang to
take down the receiver, an arrogant frown appearing at
once on his face and dominating the anxiety that had
been there ever since the evening before:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said insolently in the voice he meant
to use for Joyce in case it was Joyce.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; came back a voice equally insolent with
the effect of having been the same word thrown back
resentfully. A man&#8217;s voice. Eugene was puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he challenged with a heavy frown.
Nannette paused in the kitchen doorway and listened and
the children suspended operations on the cat and attended
maturely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Miss Joyce there?&#8221; The voice held authority,
and denied any right to interference by a third party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who <i>is</i> this?&#8221; demanded Eugene angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of Miss Radway&#8217;s,&#8221; came the prompt dignified
reply. &#8220;I wish to speak with Miss Radway.&#8221; There
was coldness in the tone. The voice had a carrying quality
and could be heard distinctly across the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, I told you so!&#8221; cried Nannette hysterically,
&#8220;The whole town will hear of it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Eugene made a violent gesture with his foot equivalent
to telling her to go into the kitchen and shut the door,
and Nannette retired out of sight with a listening ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce is busy,&#8221; said her cousin in a lordly tone.
&#8220;She can&#8217;t be interrupted now. You can leave a message
if you like that can be given her when she gets done
her work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the calm voice after a moment of what
seemed thoughtful silence, and there came a soft click.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this? Say! Who is this? Operator! Operator!
You&#8217;ve cut us off. What&#8217;s that? Who&#8217;s calling?
That&#8217;s what I want to find out. You cut us off before
the man told his name. Look that up and let me know
at once where it came from. What&#8217;s that? What number?
Why that&#8217;s your business. You ought to know
where a call came from just two minutes ago. You&#8217;ll
look it up? All right. Get busy then. I have to make
a train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; demanded Nannette appearing wide-eyed
with dish cloth in one hand and a piece of burnt
toast in the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; said her husband rudely, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see
I&#8217;m busy? I never saw such service as we have here in
this town, can&#8217;t find out who a call came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it a man calling or a woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man, of course. Isn&#8217;t there always a man where
a girl is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw a man come to see Joyce,&#8221; meditated
Nannette wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce was sly. Haven&#8217;t you learned that yet? You
women are all fools about each other anyway. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
a man, and a young one. I&#8217;ve heard his voice but I can&#8217;t
place it. Hello! Central! Central! Are you going to
keep me waiting all day? What? You can&#8217;t trace it?
That&#8217;s all bosh. Oh! You say it was a local pay station?
Well, ring it up at once. What? You don&#8217;t know
the number&mdash;Aw! That don&#8217;t go down with me. Give
me the chief operator. Operator! Operator!&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all, she&#8217;s hung up again! What time is it
anyway! Gosh hang it, I&#8217;ve missed my train. No, I don&#8217;t
want any coffee. Give me my hat; I must make that train.
No, I can&#8217;t stop to tell you anything! Where&#8217;s my coat?
It&#8217;s strange you never can help me when I&#8217;m in a hurry.
Get out of my way, Dorothea! Dang that cat, I believe
I&#8217;ve broken my toe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was gone leaving an agitated family and a breathless
cat emerging from the lilac bush where it had been
savagely kicked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow, I bet I can find out who was on
that wire,&#8221; said Dorothea maturely. &#8220;I bet they&#8217;ll know
down to the drug store. I bet I can get Dick Drew to
tell me. Most everybody phones from the drug store.
They ain&#8217;t but two or three local pay stations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still, Dorothea, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking
about,&#8221; reprimanded her mother sharply. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
go to talking or you&#8217;ll make your father awfully angry.
You go wash your hands and get off to school. You&#8217;re
going to be late. No, Junior isn&#8217;t going to stay at home.
He&#8217;s perfectly able to go to school, and I&#8217;m not going to
be bothered this morning. I&#8217;ve got too much to do to have
either of you around.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>The telephone rang again at this moment, and Nannette
hastened to answer it.</p>

<p>It was a woman&#8217;s voice this time:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this you, Joyce? Oh! Is that Mrs. Massey?
May I speak to Miss Radway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Joyce isn&#8217;t here just now,&#8221; answered Nannette
sweetly. &#8220;Is there any message? Anything I can do
for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, I guess not, thank you. How soon will
Joyce be back?&#8221; &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m not just sure,&#8221; shifted
Nannette uneasily. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I give her a message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you might tell her Martha Bryan called up
to know if she would take her Sunday-school class next
Sunday. I know it&#8217;s a little hard on her to ask her to do
it just now when she&#8217;s been through trouble, but she isn&#8217;t
one to sit down and eat her heart out when there&#8217;s work
to be done, and I thought perhaps it would help her over
a hard day to feel she was doing the Lord&#8217;s work. She
and her Aunt Mary always were ones you could rely on
to help. And I wouldn&#8217;t ask, only my daughter has been
taken sick up at Watsonville, and she wants me. I do
hate to go without seeing to my class, and I&#8217;m just sure
Joyce&#8217;ll take it. But I&#8217;ve got to leave by three o&#8217;clock.
Joyce ain&#8217;t going to be gone all day is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think not,&#8221; said Nannette nonchalantly. What
if Joyce should stay all day! How dreadful!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you ask her to call me just as soon as she
gets in. I want to relieve my mind of that class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her,&#8221; said Nannette ungraciously, &#8220;but she&#8217;s
got a lot to do at home. I doubt if she can manage it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;Oh, but she promised me six weeks ago she would if
I had to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell her.&#8221; And Nannette hung up snappily.
She didn&#8217;t exactly relish everybody in town expecting that
Joyce would go right on doing what she always had done,
as if her circumstances in life were just as they had been.
It was time people began to understand that Joyce was
a dependent, and as such was not at the beck and call of
every old woman and Sunday-school class. She was tired
and angry from loss of sleep last night, and it was high
time Joyce came home and did her work. Of course she
must be out there in the barn asleep somewhere. Probably
she was waiting for somebody to come out and coax her
in. Well, she would go out and find her. There was the
harness closet and there was the hay loft. Probably
Eugene didn&#8217;t look very far. She would find her and
teach her her duty once for all, and there wouldn&#8217;t be much
petting about it either.</p>

<p>Nannette marched out of the kitchen door with the
air of a conquering hero and sailed into the garage, the
very crackle of her step on the gravel foretelling what
was in store for any luckless miscreant who might be found
lurking in the hay.</p>

<p>But though she searched vigilantly, and thoroughly,
there was no sign anywhere of Joyce. Out behind the
barn a fluttering paper caught her eye and stopping to pick
it up she found it was an examination paper with answers
scribbled after each question in Joyce&#8217;s fine script.
Angrily she tore it in half and half again, and scattered
it on the ground, scanned the meadow for an instant, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the distant road and then went back into the house just
in time to hear the telephone ringing again.</p>

<p>It was a man&#8217;s voice this time, a strange, dignified,
young voice, a voice that spoke as from authority:</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to speak with Miss Joyce Radway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sense of panic returned to Nannette, but she summoned
voice to demand sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this?&#8221; At least she would not make Eugene&#8217;s
mistake and let any one get away without complete
identification.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is J. S. Harrington, acting superintendent of
the high school. I wish to speak to Miss Radway with
regard to her examination paper. Is she there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not,&#8221; said Nannette with asperity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you know if she is already on her way
to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette wished she did.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll not be able&mdash;&#8221; she began and then reflected
that perhaps Joyce was on her way to school. No telling
where she had spent the night with this in view. At least
she must not give away the present situation to the whole
village. Especially not to this interesting stranger. He
must be the man they were talking about at the station
last night, young and good-looking. What could he want
with Joyce?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure whether she is going over to the school
today or not,&#8221; she equivocated. &#8220;Is there any message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just ask her to step into my office if she is coming
to school. If not I shall be glad to have her call me, as
soon as she comes in. Thank you. Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The click of the telephone was almost immediately followed
by a knock on the kitchen door, where stood a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
boy with a basket of luscious strawberries covered over
with dewy leaves. He was freckled and cross-eyed, with
two upper teeth missing, but he had a most engaging smile,
and he wanted Joyce very much. He seemed dubious about
leaving the strawberries when he heard she was not at
home, and almost decided to sit down and wait, but Nannette
explained that it might be some time and he surrendered
the basket reluctantly with the message that
&#8220;Ma&#8221; had &#8220;thent &#8217;em fer Joyth and wanted the rethipe
for her y&#8217;aunth&#8217;s maple cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette regarded the strawberries with a vindictive
glare. Why should Joyce have so many friends? Since
Mother Massey died everybody seemed so interested in
doing things for Joyce and nobody seemed to bother about
her in the least, although she was the son&#8217;s wife. It certainly
wasn&#8217;t going to be pleasant living in this town until
she had made Joyce&#8217;s position quite plain. But then, after
everybody understood that Joyce couldn&#8217;t go out as much
as she used to, and wasn&#8217;t wearing such fine clothes nor
having leisure for picnics and Sunday-school classes and
the like, people would soon realize that Joyce was nothing.</p>

<p>The next call on the telephone came from the minister&#8217;s
wife. She wanted Joyce to come and take lunch with her.
She thought it might take her mind off her sorrow a little
and help her to get back into natural living again.</p>

<p>Nannette was furious, but she managed a vague reply.
Joyce was away. She wasn&#8217;t sure whether she would
be back in time for lunch or not. No, she wasn&#8217;t gone to
visit friends. She went&mdash;well&mdash;on business.</p>

<p>The minister&#8217;s wife was surprised but courteous. Later
in the afternoon the minister called. He said he had been
unusually busy since the funeral or he would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
there sooner. He said he wished to talk with Joyce about
a little matter her aunt had been interested in, and had
hoped to find that she had returned.</p>

<p>The new school superintendent called up again while
the minister was there, and seemed quite upset that Joyce
had not returned, and when she finally got rid of the minister
and went out to the kitchen to consider the possibility
of having to get dinner without Joyce&#8217;s help, she was called
back three times to the telephone. First, Susie Bassett
wanted to know if Joyce couldn&#8217;t come over and spend
the night with her, she wanted to ask her advice about
something. Then Mr. Elkins called from the store and
said his wife was all alone and not feeling very well,
and he would be so grateful if Joyce would run down and
sit with her a little while till he could get away from the
store. Then Patty Bryson from up in the country called
to ask Joyce to come up and spend a week with her and
the children while her husband was away, she thought it
would be a nice little change for Joyce.</p>

<p>With flashing eyes and sullen mouth Nannette turned
back to her kitchen only to find Mrs. Pierce her next door
neighbor standing on the doorstep just entering with a
warning tap to borrow a cup of sugar&mdash;hers hadn&#8217;t come
yet&mdash;and ask if Joyce was sick, she hadn&#8217;t seen her about
all day.</p>

<p>Nannette was almost reduced to tears when she finally
got rid of the woman who was a regular village gossip and
had the real vulture smile on her face. But it was almost
time for Eugene&#8217;s train and he was not noted for being
patient at meal times. She flew around preparing what
she could briefly, a can of soup, improvised salad out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
odds and ends, a hastily concocted custard poured over
some stale sponge cake she had hidden from the children
a week ago and forgotten till necessity brought it to light.
None of the articles were particular favorites of Eugene.
He would miss Joyce&#8217;s tasty cooking, but it could not
be helped.</p>

<p>Meantime, where were the children? Six o&#8217;clock and
they hadn&#8217;t returned since school time! What would
Eugene say if they were not here when he got home?
She hastened to the telephone to call up their familiar
spirits and get track of them, and almost every house she
called either had some message for Joyce or wanted to
know how she was bearing her trouble, and had some
good word of sympathy for her. It was maddening to
Nannette in her frantic haste, with one eye on the clock,
and the smell of the soup burning. Now she would have
to open another can. There was only a vegetable can
left and Eugene hated that.</p>

<p>Then just as she was looking up the number of the
last place where she might hope to find her missing family,
they trooped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma, is Joyce here yet? Cause our teacher&#8217;s coming
down to see her right away. Say, Ma, can&#8217;t I put on my
new organdie dress? The superintendent&#8217;s coming along
with her. I heard them planning it when I was in the
cloak room. And say, Ma, that must have been him
phoned daddy this morning, &#8217;cause I heard him say she
had awful good exams. He said they were &#8216;very clever&#8217;
just like that. I&#8217;m going up to change my dress before
they get here. I&#8217;m going to wear my new patent leathers
too. And, oh, yes, Mrs. Bryan says for you to call her up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
<i>right away</i> and tell her what Joyce said about taking her
Sunday-school class. She&#8217;s going to take the evening
train, and she&#8217;s <i>got</i> to know before she goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea&#8217;s voice trailed off up the stairs as Junior
stamped in angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Ma, what did Joyce do with my baseball bat?
I wisht she&#8217;d leave my things alone. Where is she anyhow?
Steve Jenkins says he saw her walkin&#8217; along the
State Road last night with her hat in her hand. And
the minister asked me when she was comin&#8217; back, and Miss
Freedley told me to tell her she was comin&#8217; over after supper
fer her to teach her how to knit her sweater sleeves.
And say, Ma, ain&#8217;t there any more jelly roll? I&#8217;m hungrier&#8217;n
a dozen wolves. You didn&#8217;t have hardly anything
fer lunch. I don&#8217;t see why you let Joyce go away. There
goes the telephone. I &#8217;spect that&#8217;s Ted Black. He wants
to know if Joyce can help out on the Country Week Picnic
Committee&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother swept him out of the way and answered
the phone just as Eugene entered with an angry frown:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Joyce?&#8221; he called out imperatively, just
as a strange voice over the phone asked, &#8220;Has Miss Radway
returned yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette, her nerves having reached the verge of control
snapped out an answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she hasn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know when she&#8217;s coming
back. She&#8217;s away on a visit,&#8221; and hung up the phone
with a click.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me Joyce hasn&#8217;t come back yet?&#8221;
roared Eugene ominously as his wife turned to meet him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;If you ask me that question again I&#8217;ll <i>die</i>!&#8221; screamed
Nannette, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to answer it all day long. One would
think Joyce Radway was the most important person in
this town. I think it&#8217;s ridiculous your mother letting her
get into everything this way, a charity girl! Well, you
needn&#8217;t look so cross. She was, wasn&#8217;t she, even if she
was your cousin. Everybody in this whole town is wanting
that snip of a girl for something. I told you you ought
to go out last night and make her come back. She&#8217;s as
stubborn as a mule, and we&#8217;ve got a pretty mess on our
hands. One would think she was a princess or something
the way folks act. And the new superintendent is coming
to see her tonight, and the minister wants&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something far more important than those
trifles,&#8221; glowered Eugene, &#8220;Judge Peterson has rallied
and the doctor says he may read the will this evening.
We&#8217;ve got to go over there exactly at seven and not keep
him waiting. The doctor is awfully particular about exciting
him. And I want to get this thing fixed up right
away. They say the Judge has heart trouble and might
drop off at any time now and that would make no telling
how much more delay. This is serious business for us
and you needn&#8217;t sit there and trifle about the village people!
Joyce has got to be <i>found</i>, and <i>found right away</i>. Do
you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well find her then!&#8221; retorted his wife. &#8220;You talk
as if it was my fault she went away. Haven&#8217;t I slaved all
day doing her work? And I&#8217;m done now. I&#8217;m <i>just done</i>!&#8221;
and Nannette burst into angry tears and ran upstairs to
her room, slamming the door and locking it behind her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> three-quarters of an hour Eugene made it lively
for his family. He stalked upstairs, captured his pampered
young son in the act of purloining one of his clean
handkerchiefs, gave him a cuff on the ear and ordered
him in no gentle tones to go to one end of the village as
fast as his legs could fly and find out if Joyce was at Auntie
Summers or had been there, and demand her presence at
home at once on important business. He jerked a library
book away from his daughter and sent her to the other
end of town to make the same inquiry at a home where
Joyce had been a frequent visitor, and then he strode to
his own door and shook it demanding entrance in such a
tone that Nannette dared not ignore it. He gave his hysterical
wife a rough shake and told her it was no time
to indulge her temper, that action was necessary. She
must get to work on the telephone at once and find Joyce.
They must meet that appointment at Judge Peterson&#8217;s on
the hour or they might lose everything. The son had
said that his father was very insistent about having Joyce
present when he read the will. It would look very queer
if Joyce didn&#8217;t turn up in time.</p>

<p>He succeeded in frightening Nannette sufficiently so
that she wiped her eyes and went to the telephone, calling
up one and another of Joyce&#8217;s friends, and in honeyed
tones asking if she had stopped there on her way home
and might she speak to her a minute, there was an errand
she wanted done on the way back that couldn&#8217;t wait. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
one and all said that Joyce had not been there that day, and
two women answered, &#8220;Why, I heard Joyce had gone
away on a visit&#8221; so that Nannette turned from her fruitless
task at last with a much disturbed face.</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t in town,&#8221; she said, &#8220;There isn&#8217;t another
place I can think of to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, think of all the places out of town then, find
out where she is, and I&#8217;ll get an automobile and go after
her. Little fool! She knew she was making me a lot of
trouble. She did this on purpose, I&#8217;ll wager. But she&#8217;ll
get paid back double for all she does. Just let her wait.&#8221;
Eugene was stamping up and down suggesting places to
call, while his wife with more and more agitated voice
continued to call up numbers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost sure that operator is Jenny Lowe,&#8221; she
said with her hand over the mouthpiece of the telephone,
&#8220;if it is she&#8217;ll tell it everywhere that I&#8217;ve called all these
numbers. She&#8217;s probably listening in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jenny Lowe be hanged!&#8221; said Eugene. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
to find Joyce! Look at the clock! It&#8217;s half past six. Call
Aunt Whinnie&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette called Aunt Whinnie&#8217;s but got no answer, and
while she was still trying to get it Dorothea came panting
back saying that Joyce hadn&#8217;t been heard of anywhere, and
the teacher and the superintendent were just coming into
the yard.</p>

<p>Eugene went frowning to the front door and disposed
of the new superintendent in short order saying that his
cousin had been suddenly called away and he was not sure
how soon she would return. She might be gone several
days. He intimated that she had gone to visit a sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
relative, but when the young man got out his pencil and
note book and asked for her address he replied vaguely
that he was not quite sure whether she would remain more
than a few hours where she had gone and she might make
several visits before her return. But the young superintendent
was not one who was easily baffled and asked for
all the addresses, whereupon Eugene was put to the
trouble of making up an address. It was rather hard on
him for he had been brought up not to tell lies, and he
always tried to avoid deliberate ones, but this time he felt
he was in a bad corner and had to get out somehow. The
hand of his watch said a quarter to seven, and he must
get rid of these callers. What in Sam Hill did this young
upstart want of Joyce anyway?</p>

<p>But the young upstart turned gravely away without
imparting his business, and Eugene shut the door with
unnecessary slamming, and went back to his wife:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to go over to the Judge&#8217;s and do the
best we can. We&#8217;d better fix up some story about Joyce.
Perhaps we can get around the old man. I&#8217;ll tell you,
we&#8217;ve had an offer for the house and we want to close with
it right away. Man going to Europe and wants to get this
property fixed up for a relative to live in&mdash;How&#8217;ll that
do? Then we can find a purchaser and get this house off
our hands. I&#8217;d rather go back to Chicago anyway,
wouldn&#8217;t you, and get out of this rotten town where everybody&#8217;s
nose is in your business, and the minister thinks
he owns the earth, and can boss it? I&#8217;d like to know what
business of his it was to come after Joyce anyway?
Doesn&#8217;t he think we can take care of our own relatives
without his intervention.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>At the door a small girl with tangled curls and big
blue eyes presented a note which she said was to be given
to Miss Joyce and &#8220;not to nobody else,&#8221; and which she
steadily refused to surrender even for a glimpse until
Miss Joyce should be forthcoming. There was something
racially strong and characterful in the very swing of
her little gingham petticoats as she swung sturdily down
the front path and out the gate with the note still
clasped to her bosom. Eugene called Dorothea to the
front window to identify her, and Miss Dorothea lifted her
nose contemptuously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s Darcy Sherwood&#8217;s niece, Lib Knox. She&#8217;s
a tomboy. She can throw mud just like the boys, and
once she tied a string across the sidewalk and tripped our
teacher and she fell flat, because our teacher told her she
was too dirty to come in the school yard. She&#8217;s only six
but she&#8217;s awful bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea said it virtuously, and licked her lips to hide
the jelly she had been eating out of a new tumbler she had
just opened.</p>

<p>Darcy Sherwood! What had Darcy Sherwood to do
with Joyce? Could that have been Darcy&#8217;s voice over the
phone that morning?</p>

<p>Eugene was silent and thoughtful during their walk to
Judge Peterson&#8217;s and strode so fast that Nannette could
scarcely keep pace with him. As they waited after ringing
the old-fashioned door bell he looked down frowning and
admonished his wife:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you be a fool and spill the beans.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were ushered into the Judge&#8217;s room where he
lay propped up by pillows in a great old sleigh bed, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
his wife on one side fanning him gently, and his son sitting
by the window with some papers in his hands, but as
soon as they were seated the Judge&#8217;s eyes looked toward
the door restlessly, and his big voice which had lost none
of its brusqueness with his illness, although it quavered a
little with weakness, asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Joyce? Didn&#8217;t you bring the little girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette looked frightened and turned toward her
husband to take the initiative and Eugene hastened to explain
that Joyce hadn&#8217;t been feeling well since the funeral
and they had sent her away on a little trip to relatives to
get rested after the shock of her aunt&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>The kind, rugged old face looked disappointed, and
his head sank back a little farther on the pillows:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Then there&#8217;s nothing doing,&#8221; he said as if the
matter were finished, &#8220;Dan, I thought I told you to tell
&#8217;em it was no use their coming without Joyce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, Father. I thought I made it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Judge, he told me, but I felt that if you understood
the matter you would feel it wasn&#8217;t necessary to
wait for the formality of Joyce being here. She doesn&#8217;t
know much about business anyway and would naturally
leave everything to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge eyed the younger man thoughtfully, keenly,
but said nothing more than that.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Eugene hurried on blandly, &#8220;it&#8217;s about
the house I&#8217;m especially in a hurry. We can&#8217;t do anything
till the business is settled up of course, but I&#8217;ve had an
offer for the house, an unusually good offer. The man
wants to pay cash and get possession right away. It&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
man I met in the city in business relations, and he&#8217;s going
to Europe and wants to leave his family here all safely
fixed before he has to leave. Every day counts with him,
and he&#8217;s especially anxious to get this house, and is willing
to pay a good price if he can get the thing settled up at once.
I thought perhaps you could put the matter through tonight
for me so I could take advantage of this deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Does Joyce want to sell?&#8221; questioned the old
man from his pillows, &#8220;Because if she does you better
wire her to come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what Joyce has to do with
it,&#8221; fumed Eugene. &#8220;It was my mother&#8217;s house wasn&#8217;t
it? Naturally I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the old man&#8217;s deep voice boomed out in stern and
sudden interruption:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce has a great deal to do with it. The house
belongs to Joyce.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eugene arose excitedly, his face growing suddenly
very red, his voice raised far beyond the sick room quality:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a word of it!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a rank lie! My mother&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dan Peterson stood suddenly beside him saying in
a quiet voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be all this evening, Mr. Massey. Step
this way please,&#8221; and Eugene found his arm grasped like
a vise and himself propelled rapidly out of the room with
Nannette in a frightened patter coming behind and some one
inside the room shut the door. Afterwards in remembering,
it seemed that he had heard a sound something like
a chuckle from the region of the bed. It made his blood
boil hotly when he thought of it. Of course there had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
been nothing to laugh at and yet, he felt sure the old Judge
had laughed. There must be something&mdash;he must find
Joyce at once.</p>

<p>They discussed it a long time after they got home and
Eugene had got done scolding his wife for having been
the cause of Joyce&#8217;s leaving. Eugene wanted to get a
detective at once and find Joyce. He was frantic. He
couldn&#8217;t stand the night through with this matter of the
house facing him. He even had the telephone in his hand
to call up a detective bureau in the city, but Nannette
grappled with him for it, and pleaded with him to be
reasonable for once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon as you get a detective the whole thing
will be out, and everybody will be talking. You&#8217;ll have
the whole town arrayed against us, and then where will
we be? Joyce may come back tomorrow, and then there
won&#8217;t be any need to tell any one. And anyhow you could
have called her back when she first went if you had done
what I told you, it was you that scolded her for burning
the electric light so late last night you remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was you that wore her clothes to the city wasn&#8217;t it?
It was you that taunted her for being in a menial position!
and wouldn&#8217;t hear to her going to those examinations that
she set so much store by, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;&mdash;responded he.</p>

<p>Into the midst of this loud altercation there came a tap
on the side door close to which Eugene was sitting. It was
so startling for any one to come to that door at that time
of night that Eugene jumped and sat up. Both were
absolutely still for a quarter of a second. Nannette even
turned a little white as she stared toward the door which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
had four latticed panes of glass and was lightly draped in
open fish net.</p>

<p>Nannette recovered first.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is, I suppose,&#8221; she said in a low whisper
with lips that scarcely moved, for she was conscious that
she must be under the eye of whoever was outside. &#8220;For
pity&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t rave now and send her off again. And
don&#8217;t you give in either. She needs a lesson after acting
like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>She arose and gathered up her hat and wrap which
were lying where she had thrown them when she came in
from Judge Peterson&#8217;s. Her action seemed to bring
Eugene to his senses. He got up and went to the door,
opening it but a few inches and looking out with an air
of affront.</p>

<p>But Joyce was not outside, as he had half made up his
mind she would be. A man stood there in the darkness, a
stranger he seemed to be at first glimpse, tall, well built,
of almost haughty bearing&mdash;a thing Eugene could never
tolerate in any man but himself. For a moment they stood
gazing at one another. It was almost as if the man outside
were sizing up the man who stood against the light.
Then Eugene remarked acridly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want?&#8221; giving the door the least
bit of an impatient jerk as if he were about to close it.
The visitor must speak quickly.</p>

<p>There was perfect courtesy in the voice that replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Massey? Sherwood&#8217;s my name. I&#8217;d like to
have a few words with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a grave assurance about the young man&#8217;s
tone that irritated Eugene. Then he reflected that the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
might have some news concerning Joyce and it would be
as well to hear him through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you don&#8217;t take too long,&#8221; he said curtly,
stepping out to the porch and drawing the door to after
him. &#8220;We were just about to retire. I suppose you&#8217;re
aware it&#8217;s rather late for callers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man lifted his hat with a grave smile that
showed a row of irritatingly beautiful teeth, and gave him
somehow the appearance of great advantage, but instead
of telling his errand he put his hand out and pushed open
the door saying pleasantly, and almost with an air of
authority:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just go inside if you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; and was in
before Eugene could resent his action. This was most
extraordinary behaviour and Eugene half ready to eject
him for his presumption, was yet somehow compelled to
follow him.</p>

<p>It was quite evident as they entered that the visitor had
intended to come inside for a purpose, for he did not hide
the fact that he was taking in the whole sitting room with
a quick keen glance, and even the hall and stairs and the
living room beyond. He bowed deferentially to Nannette
as she slid back into the room, curiosity in every line of
her face.</p>

<p>Seen in the light of the room his face was extremely
handsome, with an easy carelessness upon it that showed
he made no merit of his comeliness, and cared little for
impressions. Yet when he smiled even an enemy must
needs listen:</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to see whether Joyce Radway has come home
yet?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>The tone demanded a straightforward answer, in fact
it was like a command, as of one who had the right to
know. Eugene stiffened, resentfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;She has not,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I believe I told you
that over the phone a little while ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; said Sherwood. &#8220;I came to make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a glance about that had a sense of listening in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; bristled Eugene.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did she go away, just what time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business of yours is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t any of my business. I&#8217;m making it mine.
What time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, find out if you can. I don&#8217;t answer impertinent
questions.&#8221; Eugene was white with anger. He
would have liked to have put this intruder out, only the
man was nearly twice his size.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I intend to do!&#8221; answered the visitor
taking a step into the room where he could look well
through the hall and living room without effort. There
was a grim set look about his face that meant business, and
yet he turned to Nannette with that winning smile he
could flash forth suddenly like the sun coming out from
behind a cloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Massey, I&#8217;m not a bandit, and I&#8217;m not as impertinent
as your husband seems to think, although I may
be a trifle unconventional, but it is necessary for me to
find out when Joyce Radway left this house and I mean to
do so. If you&#8217;ll excuse me I&#8217;ll just step upstairs and speak
to your son a minute. Don&#8217;t trouble yourself to lead the
way. I&#8217;ll find him all right&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He took one swift stride into the hall, before Eugene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
realized what he was doing and bustled irately to stop
him. But the stranger did not need to go far, for Junior in
bare feet and pajamas was hanging over the balustrade,
his ears alert for the family scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Buddie,&#8221; the young man said in a tone he
might have used to an older pal.</p>

<p>Junior straightened up involuntarily and a gleam
came into his eye. He threw one leg over the balustrade
and balanced grinning, emitting a low &#8220;&#8217;ello!&#8221; It was
plain that he was both pleased and embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still interested in that baseball bat of mine, are you
Kid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; responded Junior coming down to the steps
again and sticking his tongue in his cheek expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how about that package you were to deliver?
Did you deliver it last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Junior hung his head, and wriggled on one bare toe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he murmured in a low voice. &#8220;She went
away &#8217;fore I had the chance. She didn&#8217;t come back yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, son,&#8221; said the young man pleasantly,
&#8220;That&#8217;s all I want to know. May I trouble you for
the package?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got it hid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get it, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Junior!&#8221; broke forth Nannette&#8217;s indignant voice,
&#8220;come here to me this instant.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Junior&#8217;s bare heels were flying up the stairs, and
before his mother could pursue him he returned with a
small indiscriminate bundle which he thrust over the
balustrade where it disappeared inside the visitor&#8217;s coat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;All right, Buddie, the bat is yours when you call for
it tomorrow. At the old stand. You know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw&#8217;right!&#8221; answered Junior with delight in his
eyes. It was plain that his mother was nowhere in his
vision while this hero was in sight.</p>

<p>The young man turned and walked swiftly back
through the sitting room past the angry father and mother
and over to the door. With the door knob firmly grasped
in his hand he turned once more and faced his host:</p>

<p>&#8220;I happened to see Miss Radway alone on a lonely
road quite late last night and was interested to know if
she reached home in safety. I thought perhaps we might
work together to find her if there was any necessity. But
since you do not care to co&ouml;perate I will wish you good
evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man flashed a distant smile and opening the
door was gone, before the man and woman realized what
he was about to do.</p>

<p>For an instant they looked at each other speechless.
Then Nannette broke forth:</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have asked him where he saw her! Go
after him quick! Don&#8217;t let him get away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stung into action Eugene opened the door and called
into the night:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say! Come here! Wait a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>But his words seemed to float out on emptiness.</p>

<p>Eugene stood in the door for a moment listening, but
there seemed to be no echo of footsteps. Yet it was
scarcely a second since the visitor had stood inside the door.
Where could he have gone? It was almost uncanny.</p>

<p>Nannette came and looked out the door, and Eugene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
hurried down the walk calling out again, but no answer
came, and his own voice seemed to mock him. He looked
up and down the street, but saw no one. He walked
around the house, and back to the gate again. There was
no sound of automobile in the quiet moonlit street. Everybody
had gone to bed and the lights were out. Strange!
How could the man have disappeared?</p>

<p>&#8220;Junior! Who was that man?&#8221; screamed Nannette
remembering and rushing back into the house. But Junior
had a realizing sense of his disloyalty to his family, and
had fled to his bed with the clothes tucked tightly around
his ears, and his eyes screwed shut as if in deep slumber.
When rudely shaken into being he yawned reprovingly and
asked, &#8220;What man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannette brought him at last to a proper appreciation
of the necessity and he nonchalantly replied, &#8220;Oh, him?
He&#8217;s our coach, Darce Sherwood. You just oughta see
him pitch a ball. He&#8217;s some cracker-jack pitcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Questioned further concerning the package he said he
guessed some old woman had sent it to Joyce. He guessed
it was some seeds or &#8220;sumpin&#8221; to put on Grandma&#8217;s
grave.</p>

<p>The mother and father looked at one another completely
puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly had no right to go away that way without
telling me where he saw Joyce,&#8221; declared Eugene
angrily. &#8220;Now I suppose I shall have to go out and find
him. The insolent sucker! He thought he had me in a
hole. I <i>won&#8217;t</i> go after him. Let him go to the dogs.
Probably he never saw Joyce at all. What difference does
it make if he did? Serves her right if she gets in trouble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
I&#8217;m not going to hunt him up that&#8217;s certain. I&#8217;ll get a
detective. What&#8217;s he got to do with Joyce anyhow I&#8217;d
like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then everybody&#8217;ll find out&mdash;&#8221; wailed Nannette.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference if they do? They&#8217;ll find out
if she doesn&#8217;t come back at all, won&#8217;t they? You haven&#8217;t
a brain cell working. You&#8217;re just <i>like</i> a woman&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Gene, why don&#8217;t you see that this man is the
only clue you have to where she was last seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what if he is? Do you think I&#8217;m going crawling
to a man that entered my house that way&mdash;? Say!
That&#8217;s an idea! I&#8217;ll have him arrested for house breaking.
He came into my house against my express command.
I told him we were retiring. I told him I would talk to
him outside. But he just opened the door and walked in
and said we would talk inside. I&#8217;ll call up the police and
have him arrested before he gets home, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.
Then we&#8217;ll tell him we&#8217;ll release him when he tells where
Joyce is. Perhaps he&#8217;s got her kidnapped somewhere.
Perhaps he knows more than he&#8217;s willing to tell&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>But while they were discussing it Darcy Sherwood was
striding over the meadows and vaulting the fences back
of their house, till he reached the public highway along
which Joyce had walked the evening before.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Joyce felt her wrists clasped in that iron grip
in the darkness, and felt the hot breath of a man on her
face, she was more frightened than she had ever been in
her life. All the stories of horrors in the night, of hold-ups
and bandits and kidnappings came to her mind as she
struggled vainly for a moment in that vise-like grip. She
tried to scream, though she knew she was too far away
from houses to reach the ear of any people who lived about
unless some one happened to be going along that road; and
people did not go along that road at night unless they had
to. It was lonely and desolate, and out of the way from
the main highway, a quiet remote place for the dead. She
had a quick feeling of thankfulness that Aunt Mary who
had always been so careful for her safety, so anxious
when she was out alone at night, was where she could not
be alarmed; a quick wish that she could call to her. Then
the thought of God came and her heart cried for help.</p>

<p>The flashlight sprung in her face sent her almost
swooning. She was conscious that her senses were going
from her, and that she must somehow prevent herself
from going out this way in the dark, and then up through
the billows of blackness that were surging to envelop
her soul she heard her own name in startled, almost
tender tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce!&#8221;</p>

<p>And back through the blackness she came again to
earth and consciousness and opened her eyes, straight into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the eyes that searched her face; answering the call of that
strangely familiar voice. &#8220;Oh&mdash;was it you?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was troubled relief in the voice as she said it,
relief as if she would rather have had back the terror than
to have found this one involved in the mystery. There was
question, pain, almost reproach, in her tone; there was
judgment held in suspense as if her soul rejected the
witness of her eyes. Then, as if she could not bear the
conclusion of her own judgment she cried out earnestly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>what</i> were you doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped her hands as if they had been shot away
from him and his head drooped, stooped perhaps would
be better, as if a great burden had suddenly been let upon
his shoulders. He tried to speak and his voice was husky,
the words did not come from his lips. He half turned
away with a motion as if he would hide his face.</p>

<p>Then a low stealthy whistle rasped between them and
he started back toward her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&mdash;&#8221; he said quickly, &#8220;Go! You must not be seen
here! Joyce&mdash;Little Joyce&mdash;&#8221; the last syllables were
scarcely audible. She heard them in her soul afterward,
like a long echo of a very fine whisper. A clear whistle
close beside her, resonant, remembered from childhood,
sounded just above her bowed head as she turned, and she
knew he was signalling to the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go! Straight down the road! Keep in the shadow.
I&#8217;ll come back after awhile and find you,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid&mdash;&#8221; and in the same breath, louder:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Kid, nothing but a scared rabbit. We&#8217;ll
go up the other way&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was striding away from her rapidly into the darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and she stood almost petrified in the road where he
left her, till she heard a rough laugh of one of his companions
and fear lent strength to her feet once more and
sped her down the road again.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating wildly, and her thoughts in a
chaos. She could not think, nor analyze her own feelings.
She could only fly along in the shadow, stumbling now and
again over a rough bit of road, straining her ears to listen
for sounds behind her, casting a fearful glance back.</p>

<p>But the darkness was reassuring. The dimmed lights
of the automobile that had stood by the roadside were no
longer visible. The men had gone away in the other
direction. She was alone on the road&mdash;with at least
another mile to go before she could turn again into the
highway, and she found an overwhelming tremble upon
her. Her very spirit seemed to be quivering with it. The
night which had been warm and balmy seemed turned to
fearful cold and she shivered as she tried to hurry along.
Now and then the moon swept out and threw her shadow
along the way, and she glanced furtively behind her and
shrank into the shadow of the elderberry bushes by the
fence. Once a wild rabbit scuttled across the road and
startled her so that she almost fell. She began to reproach
herself for having gone away from home in this silly aimless
way, losing her temper like a child and walking out
from safety and protection without preparation. She
wondered if God were angry with her for it. She
wondered why she had done it and what she was going to
do anyway, but most of all she wondered what those dark
figures on the hillside had been doing, and why the
shoulders of her friend had drooped as if with shame.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Most of all this dragged upon her soul and kept her from
fleetness. For how must the feet drag when the heart is
weighed down!</p>

<p>She came at last into the highway, and heard by the
tolling of the clock on a distant barn that it was two
o&#8217;clock. It gave her a strange sense of detachment from
the world to be thus adrift at that dark, prowling time of
the night.</p>

<p>The road was empty either way. Not even a light
of a distant car was in sight. If she could only hope to
find a place of shelter before another came. Surely it
could not be much longer so empty on the highway. Some one
would be going by. Some one would see her. They
would think it strange. They would think ill of her if they
saw her. There was no hope for help from any passing
car. She would not dare accept it if it were offered.</p>

<p>Ahead she saw a strip of woods. Her brain began to
function. That would be the grove just before you came
to old Julia Hartshorn&#8217;s house, and Julia Hartshorn lived
just outside of Heatherdell. Heatherdell was a little town
and she knew many of the people. She would not be
lonely there. But where could she go? She must not be
seen out at that time of night by any one she knew unless
she came to it and appealed for help. That would mean
that she would have to tell the circumstances of her being
out from home in the blackness of night. That would mean
criticism for Eugene and Nannette, no matter how gently
she might tell her tale, nor how much she took the blame
upon herself. And that would have hurt Aunt Mary. For
Aunt Mary&#8217;s sake she must not let any talk go around.
Aunt Mary knew that Nannette was jealous of her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
that Eugene was sometimes hard on her, but Aunt Mary
loved her son, even though she knew his faults, and Joyce
would never willingly make any gossip that would reflect
upon the family. Eugene was right. He knew Joyce&#8217;s
conscience. It was functioning right on true to type even
now in her terror and perplexity.</p>

<p>If only she had not gone to that cemetery! If only
she had not turned aside and allowed herself to give up
and cry upon Aunt Mary&#8217;s grave, and lose all that time.
She might have been far away now, in a safe, quiet room
somewhere that she had hired for the night. There would
have been places where she could have found a room for
a very little. She had some money, she didn&#8217;t remember
how much, with her&mdash;it didn&#8217;t matter. There were a few
dollars. Perhaps, too, she had put that gold piece in her
handbag, she wasn&#8217;t sure of that. The day had been so
long and hard, so many things had been within its hours.
She could not recall what she had picked up to carry with
her that morning. She was too weary to care.</p>

<p>But she couldn&#8217;t bear to go away without bidding good-bye
to the spot where Aunt Mary and her mother lay, and
perhaps too she had felt she could better think what to
do, there in the quiet with the two graves.</p>

<p>Well, there was no use in excusing herself. She had
gone. She shuddered at the horror of the last hour, and
then that burden again to find out it was that one&mdash;and
to wonder. What had he been doing? Was it then true,
all the whispers that had come to her ears, of his life?</p>

<p>Around the bend ahead dashed a light. A car was
coming at last. She remembered he had said he would
come after her. She glanced back, but it was all darkness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Even if he did come would she want to meet him?
Could she explain her presence out at night? He was
now an almost stranger. He knew naught of her life.
And perhaps it would be better if she did not know his.</p>

<p>She glanced fearfully ahead. The light was growing
brighter, was almost blinding. She stepped out of its
range and crept among some bushes till the glare and the
swift passing car were gone, and watched the little red tail
light blink and disappear. Then keeping quite close to
the bank she slid along, fearful of another car so near to
the bend of the road. It might come upon her unaware and
if she were in the glare she would naturally be noticed by
the driver. She trembled at the very thought, and hurried
along, limbs sometimes stumbling and almost falling in
the tall grass.</p>

<p>But presently she came in sight of Julia Hartshorn&#8217;s
cottage, a little quiet brown affair, with gingerbread fretwork
on its porches and moss on its roof, set far back
from the street in a grove of maples, like a tiny island
off the mainland of the larger grove near by.</p>

<p>A picket fence with scaling ancient paint, and a gate
with a chain and weight guarded the quiet haven, and
the fitful moonlight quavered out and showed the dim
outline of a hammock slung between the maples close to
the west porch. Joyce remembered a long, beautiful afternoon
when she had lain in that hammock and read a book
while Aunt Mary sat on the porch with Julia Hartshorn
and sewed. How long ago and how beautiful that seemed.
How like heaven in contrast with what she had been going
through lately! Yes, here was a haven. She might go
and knock at the door, and Julia&#8217;s night-capped old head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
would appear at the window above. She had only to
tell who it was and that she was in trouble, and the door
would be open wide for her. Neither would Julia Hartshorn
ever tell.</p>

<p>But Julia Hartshorn was old, and she had a sharp-tongued
niece who had come to live with her and go to
school. It would never do. She must not venture that.
The school in Heatherdell was too near to the school in
Meadow Brook, and too much gossip went back and forth.
No, she must keep to her lonely way and go on. But
there was no reason why she might not slip into that gate
for a little while and lie in that hammock till daylight began
to come. She could steal in so quietly no one would ever
know, and get out again before the household was awake.
She would be entirely safe outside a dwelling house of
course, and need not fear to sleep for a few minutes under
such protection.</p>

<p>Softly she lifted the latch of the old gate, lifting the
gate as she swung it cautiously open lest it creak, and
let herself in, closing it noiselessly behind her. Still as
a creature of the woods she stole up the grass and tiptoed
across the walk to the hammock, sliding gently into it,
and slowly relaxing her tense muscles. It seemed as
though she had suddenly been tossed up by a terrible and
angry sea where her very soul had been racked from her
body and laid upon a quiet stretch of sand, so wonderful
it was to lie and rest.</p>

<p>She scarcely knew when her thoughts relaxed from
their intense strain and rested with her body or when
the night blurred into sleep and took her trouble all away.
She only realized as she was drifting off, that her soul was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
crying, &#8220;Oh, God! Forgive me if I&#8217;ve done wrong. Take
care of me, and show me what to do! For Jesus&#8217; sake&mdash;take
care of me&mdash;show me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was that a dream or footsteps stealthily along the
road, pausing at the gate, noiseless footsteps like those
in the cemetery? He was coming back&mdash;but he must not.
Oh, what was he doing out there in the dark! Something
that he was ashamed of? He had drooped and had not
answered! &#8220;Oh, God, show him!&#8221; Was there some one
at the gate? Or was it fancy. Ah&mdash;now they seemed
to be going on. How sweet the breeze on her forehead&mdash;like
the breeze from the open kitchen door. &#8220;Oh, God.
Save him! Help me! Show me what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned with a luminous pink in the east
and a sudden twitter of birds. April, and four o&#8217;clock
in the morning; asleep in a hammock under a tree. What
could be more perfect?</p>

<p>Joyce, half conscious of the wonder all about her,
had come to life with the first bird, and a sense of peace
upon her. The daylight was coming and God had kept
her. She might go on her way now and be undisturbed.
Then a stab of pain at the memory of the night before
brought her further awake. A low flying bird almost
brushed her cheek with its wing, and the petals of the
apple blossoms drifted down in her face. Such exquisite
perfume, such melody of many throats, would it
be something like this when one wakened in heaven and
heard the voices of the angel songs?</p>

<p>Beyond her sheltering tree the dim outlines of the
old house loomed gently in the gray morning, such peace
and safety all about. How good to be resting here.</p>

<p>But Julia Hartshorn&#8217;s niece had picked out this especial
morning to get up early and do some house cleaning before
going to school, and just as Joyce was allowing herself
to drift off again into drowsiness Jane Hartshorn&#8217;s alarm
clock set up such a clang into the melody of the morning
that Joyce came to herself in terror and sat up looking
fearfully toward the house. Not for anything would she
have them discover her there. She must get up and get
out before the light. She must hasten now for some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
was evidently going to arise at once, and it was not safe
to remain another second.</p>

<p>Hastily she felt for her handbag, realized that she
had only one book instead of two, groped in the darkness
for her hat which had fallen to the ground, and slid softly
out of the hammock.</p>

<p>A glance toward the house showed a light in one of
the upper windows and in a panic she stole breathlessly
from bush to bush and from shadow to shadow till she
reached the gate and the high road. Then a new fear
overtook her. She would run the risk of meeting early
milk carts, perhaps stray tramps if she walked along
through the village. Some one might recognize her. It
would not do at this early hour in the morning. Where
could she hide until a respectable hour for a young woman
to be out alone? How could she explain her presence there?
For she was not one of the modern girls who go where
they please and let people think what they like. She had
been taught that there was a certain consideration for
one&#8217;s reputation that was right and perfectly consistent
with independence. One of the precepts that Aunt Mary
had ingrained into her nature had been that good old Bible
verse, &#8220;Let not your good be evil spoken of&#8221; and she
had grown up with a sane and wholesome idea of values
that helped immensely when she came to a crisis anywhere.</p>

<p>She hurried down the road which would presently
merge into the village street, as noiselessly as possible,
and cast about for a possible retreat. Then she came to
a low rail fence skirting a pasture. The breath of the cows
came sweetly in the gray dawn, mingled with the smell
of earth and growing things. She could look across a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
wide expanse to wooded hills several miles away. There
seemed to be no buildings to suggest the presence of
humans, and cows were safe friends&mdash;at least most of
them. She could keep close to the fence and climb if there
happened to be a bull in the lot. With a hasty glance
backward and each way she climbed the fence and dropped
into the pasture, skirting along its edge, and down away
from the street. It was still too dark for her to be visible
from the road, and she would surely find somewhere to
sit down and wait until a respectable hour.</p>

<p>She made her way safely through two pastures, stumbling
now and then over the clumps of violets, or little
hillocks of grass, but the meadow was for the most part
smooth with the cropping of the cows, and it was growing
lighter all the time.</p>

<p>In the second pasture the ground dipped till it came
to a little rivulet tinkling along over bright pebbles, and
giving an absurdly miniature reflection of the dawn in
pink and gold as it ran; and here, under a great old chestnut
tree, she dropped down and looked about her.</p>

<p>Off to the right perhaps half a mile away there was
a red barn, and house beyond it with smoke coming
from the chimney. Farther away a village church spire
rose among the trees. It was all so quiet and peaceful with
the first tinge of red light from the sunrise putting a halo
upon everything. Joyce never remembered having been
out at this hour before, all alone with the spring. The
fear of the night before had fled and it was as if she were
sitting safe watching God make a new day. She wondered
as the miracle of the sun began to appear in a great ruby
light, what this day would bring forth for her. It hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
seemed real to her yet, what she had passed through since
she left home. The experience in the cemetery was like
an awful dream. She shuddered to think of it. Was
it because an old friend had fallen from a high pedestal
where she had placed him many years ago? Was it because
a nameless fear hovered about her, and she could
not bear to search out in her mind what he might have
been doing? Whatever it was she realized that she must
put it away until she had time and privacy. There were
more important things to decide now and she must keep
her poise and plan her day. It would soon be light enough
for her to go upon her way and she must know where she
was going and what she should try to do.</p>

<p>In the first place she must find out how much money
she had with her. She had very little of her own any
way in change, and in her hurry she was afraid she might
have left that behind. She opened her handbag and turned
it carefully upside down in her lap, quickly sorting out
its contents, the lace, the handkerchiefs and the little trinkets
in one pile, the papers and letters in another, and oh,
joy, she had brought her purse. She opened it quickly
to assure herself of its contents. Yes, there was the gold
piece that she had been saving so long, the precious gold
piece that had been a present from her own mother when
she was a tiny girl. Ten dollars had seemed a great sum
when she was small and Aunt Mary had encouraged her to
keep it and use it for something nice that she would like
to keep always as a gift from her mother. That she would
not use except as a last resort. She snapped the little inner
pocket shut and turned to the next compartment, counting
the pennies and dimes and half dollars and quarters carefully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
There were three dollars and sixty-five cents, the
change from the five dollar bill with which she paid for
her gloves to wear to the funeral. Last she opened the
little strapped pocket that held her bills. She had been
carefully hoarding her last month&#8217;s allowance, and the
few dollars saved from the months before to get a new
coat and some things she would need for the winter in
case she passed her examinations and got a school to teach.
But she had been obliged to dip into her savings several
times just before Aunt Mary died, and afterward to get
things for Aunt Mary that Eugene did not think of or
consider necessary, and now she was not sure just how
much she had left. She counted, slowly, one ten dollar bill,
three fives, a two dollar bill, nine ones, and two silver
dollars. It looked a lot as she went over it again to
make sure, thirty-eight dollars, and with the three sixty-five
it made forty-one dollars and sixty-five cents. Of
course the ten dollar gold piece made it fifty-one in all,
but she was not counting that. That was to be saved at
all hazards for the thing that she wanted most as a gift
from her mother. Not unless life itself were endangered
would she touch it, she resolved.</p>

<p>But forty-one dollars ought to keep her if she were
careful until she could earn more. It didn&#8217;t look a lot
when one considered that she was starting in the world,
but just suppose she hadn&#8217;t anything. Girls had been in
a predicament like that before. God was good to her. She
would have to save every cent carefully, and get a job of
some sort at once. She must not waste a day. Jobs were
not easy to find, either, when one could give no references.
She would not dare give references because somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Eugene would make things unpleasant for her. No one
must find out where she was. She realized that Eugene
and Nannette felt that they had a good thing in her to
do their work and look after the children, while they went
around and had a good time, and that they would not
easily let her go. They would not stop at talking a little
against her if by so doing they could lose her a job and
bring her back to take care of them. This conclusion had
been forcing itself upon her for some time slowly, and
had been fully revealed by their actions of the day before.
She did not want to make any trouble, nor any talk in
the town, but she was fully resolved not to go back to
them. She felt that if Aunt Mary were here now, in the
light of all the things that had been said to her since the
funeral, she would not advise her to remain there. Indeed,
there had been hints now and then before Aunt Mary was
so sick, such as &#8220;If you should ever consider it advisable
not to live with Gene and Nan, dear,&#8221; or &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell
what may develop when you get to teaching. I know Nan
isn&#8217;t easy to get along with&mdash;.&#8221; But these were only hints,
and Aunt Mary had expected to get well. They all had
expected her to, until the last three weeks of her illness.
Joyce had shrunk from talking about the possibilities of
death, and so it seemed had Aunt Mary. After all, it
was her responsibility now, and she was doing what seemed
the best for all. She could never live in Eugene&#8217;s house.
Her breath seemed stifled. How could she study and have
her light watched every night? How could she be hampered
in her comings and goings if she were to earn her
own living? No, she had been right to come away. Perhaps
the break might have been done more formally, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
precipitated in such a headlong way, that was her greatest
fault to jump headlong into a situation, but even so it
would likely have been harder. She could hear even now
the long arguments before she had brought the Masseys
to her viewpoint. Indeed she doubted if she would ever
have brought them there, or have been allowed to go away
if they had really thought she meant it. She was half surprised
at herself that she was really gone from home so
easily, half expected to have Gene walk to her out of the
dim of the morning and order her home. She remembered
then for the first time that Gene had been fuming about
the delay in the reading of the will and likely she ought
to have remained until after that out of respect to her aunt,
but after all, if Aunt Mary had been going to leave her
something, some furniture or a little bit of money, while
it would have been nice to have it, it would only have gendered
more strife. Why not let Gene have it all? That
would likely compensate for the loss of her service in the
family, and it would have been hard to stay there and
see Nan turn Aunt Mary&#8217;s house upside down, perhaps sell
or dispose of some of the dear old things that had grown
precious through the years. It was just as well that she
was gone before it came up at all. When she was settled
in some nice place and everything fully assured she would
write some letters to her old friends and to Gene and Nan
and tell them where she was so that there would be no
talk about her going. And she knew Nan well enough to
be sure that until such time as they heard from her Nan
would cover her going by some clever story of a visit to
friends. She thought that it would not be more than a
few days before she was in a position to write.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Having settled her finances she took up the pile of
papers and letters, tied them in a neat packet and bestowed
them in the pocket of her serge dress. She was like a
bird let out of a cage. She could not go back, not while
the sunshine of the new day was coming, not even if it
grew dark and lowering. She would rather quiver in
the heart of her own tree than be caged again for the
pleasure of others and obliged to sing whether she felt
like it or not.</p>

<p>As she reached this decision and put the little packet
of letters firmly in her pocket a ray of sun reached out
a warm finger and touched her hair, and she realized that
the day was come and she must soon go on her way.
Hastily she went through the other things in her lap.
The trinkets and lace she folded into a handkerchief and
pinned it inside her dress. Having thus lightened her
handbag she set about making a meagre toilet.</p>

<p>The brook was at hand, sparkling and clear, in which
to wash her face, and she had a tiny mirror in her bag
to tidy her hair. By way of breakfast until she could do
better she folded one of the examination question papers
into a cup and drank a long, sweet draught.</p>

<p>While she was setting her hat straight, far in the
distance she heard a humming sound, and for the first
time she noticed the poles and wires of a trolley line perhaps
half a mile away over the fields. Sure enough! That
was the new trolley line that had just been completed.
She could ride on it as far as it went and then walk to
another line perhaps. Somehow now that she was away
she wanted to go far enough away from home to be really
in a new atmosphere, where people would not find her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
and tell the Masseys about her. She must get at least a
hundred miles away from home, perhaps more, or it would
be no use going at all. Yet she dared not take much of
a ride on the train, it would eat into her small hoard too
much and leave her nothing to get started on when she
found a new home. But a trolley! One could go a good
many miles for five cents. She strained her eyes to watch
for the car and soon spied it, a black speck moving from
the east, growing momently larger and more distinct
against the brightness of the morning. There would likely
be another one going in the opposite direction soon. Could
she make it across the fields before it came? They would
probably run every half-hour. If she missed this next
one it would not be so long to wait for the next. Was it
too early for a girl to board a car in the open country?
She eyed the sun. It could not be more than five o&#8217;clock.
She decided to try for it, and picking up her small effects
was soon on her way across the fields.</p>

<p>Fortune favored her, and a car came along soon after
she arrived at the highway. She boarded it and found
a seat in the end next to a laborer with a pickaxe and
muddy boots, who was fast asleep and did not even know
when she sat down. Most of the men in the car were
laborers and were nodding drowsily, scarcely looking at
one another. She was the only woman in the car, but
they paid no heed to her, and she dropped back into the
seat as the car lurched on its way, thankful that her hasty
glance revealed no acquaintance from Meadow Brook or
Heatherdell. She put her head back against the window
and closed her eyes and her senses seemed to swim away
from her. She suddenly realized that she had had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
supper the night before and no breakfast but spring water
that morning. All the strain of the day before and the
terrible night seemed to climax in that moment, and for
an instant she felt as if she were losing her consciousness.
Then her will came to the front and she set her lips and
determined to pull through no matter how hard the ride
or how long the fast. She was young and this was her
testing. She must not, she would not faint.</p>

<p>The car stopped for a moment to let on some more
tired-looking men going to their work, and a whiff of
spring blew in at her window fanning her brow. She
thought again of the hand of her mother, and wondered
if God were reminding her that He cared, and new strength
seemed to come into her.</p>

<p>She was awakened from a half drowse at the next stop
by the sound of a voice that sent terror through her heart.
It was the same hoarse voice breaking out in raucous
laughter that she had heard half subdued in the graveyard
the night before, the one they had called &#8220;Kid.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> sat up startled and peered furtively from her
window.</p>

<p>The man was outside waiting to board the car. He
was big and red and ugly, with bold blue eyes and red
hair. He had a weak mouth and a cruel jaw, and she
couldn&#8217;t help shrinking into her corner as she looked.
Suppose he had been the one to catch her and hold her
hands in a vise-like grip last night! Her soul turned
sick within her.</p>

<p>He came up the steps prating in a loud voice about
women, called them &#8220;dames&#8221; and &#8220;skirts,&#8221; and his
laughter was an offense. Laughter is like smells, it can
be fragrant as the morning or it can be foul as the breath
of a gutter. This man&#8217;s laughter was like a noxious gas.</p>

<p>Joyce would have fled if the aisle had not been blocked
either way. Failing in that she shrank still further back
in her seat, drew her hat over her eyes, and found herself
trembling in every fibre. Why did such a man have to
be on the earth, she wondered as she heard his voice going
on in coarse remarks. And what possible companionship,
even in business, could he have with the man she knew,
whom she had always thought fine of soul?</p>

<p>The stab of that question came into her morning with
renewed sharpness as she was compelled to sit and listen,
as were all the rest of the passengers in the car, to this
crude man&#8217;s conversation.</p>

<p>There was nothing to fear of course, for it was broad
daylight and there were plenty of men in the car whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
faces told that they would defend her. They might be
all common workingmen, but they had homes and mothers
and wives and sisters and they respected them. There was
a kind of nobleness in their faces that made one sure
of that.</p>

<p>Joyce sat motionless and tried to still the trembling
of her lips, tried to control the foolish desire to let the tears
come into her eyes, tried to tell herself she was silly, and
only needed her breakfast and there was no sense in her
giving way to her feelings like this. This man did not
know her. He had no idea that she had been the intruder
at his midnight work. Oh, that work&mdash;that terrible
work! What was it that bound these men together,
the one so coarse, the other who had always seemed so
fine? It haunted her with dark possibilities. Some money
making scheme of course it was. But&mdash;it must be something
terrible! She could not forget the look, the droop
of the man in the darkness, when she had asked him
about it.</p>

<p>And this other one. He must live somewhere near
where he had boarded the car. He was not any one from
Meadow Brook. The business was a partnership with
strangers, yet the one she knew had been the captain, the
head of it all. It was his voice that had given the orders,
that had told them to go back and not come after her.
Why should he be bound up in something that all too
clearly was illicit&mdash;something of which he was ashamed?
How she wished she had not had to know this about her
one time friend. Of course she had not seen him much
since the old school days&mdash;but it had never seemed possible
that anything gruesome, mysterious,&mdash;<i>wrong</i>, could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
connected with him. It would have been much pleasanter
to have gone away from home carrying with her to the
end of life the pleasant thoughts of those she left behind,
those who were connected in any way with the dearness
of the old days.</p>

<p>But this was no time to think of such things. The
morning was full upon them in a flood of sunshine, and
the car was coming to a halt at what seemed like some
kind of a terminal. There was a platform, and a shed-like
shelter, and the entire car arose as one man and
crowded out on the platform. Joyce waited until they
were gone and slipping out the other end went around
the back of the car, crossed the tracks and walked rapidly
up a side street, rejoicing to hear the hum of the cross
line trolley for which the men seemed to be waiting.
It would be good to know that that dreadful man was gone.</p>

<p>On the first corner was a small grocery whose door
was just being unlocked by a sleepy looking lad, and Joyce
went in and bought a box of crackers and some cheese.
This would reinforce her and save time. She wanted
to get well out of this region before people began to be
about much. She did not care to run any risk of meeting
any one she knew who would go back home and talk
about it.</p>

<p>So, munching her crackers and cheese, she walked
briskly down the street, a new one evidently, filled with
rows of neat two-story houses, some of which were
not yet fully finished, for workmen were about and signs
were up for rent and sale.</p>

<p>At a broader cross street she turned the corner and
came full upon a band of men who were working away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
at a sewer that was being laid, and suddenly from out
of the group arose the noxious laughter of the red-haired
man of the trolley. She stopped as if she had been shot,
and wheeled, back to the quieter street of the small houses.
But not back in time to escape the mocking words that
were flung after her:</p>

<p>&#8220;There she comes! That&#8217;s my girlie! Isn&#8217;t she a
pippin? Oh, don&#8217;t run away darling! I won&#8217;t let the
naughty men hurt you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Words could not describe the taunting tone nor her
horror, as if she had been desecrated. She was trembling
and the tears were flowing down her cheeks as she fled,
block after block without knowing whither she went.
It seemed so degrading that she could not rally her usual
common sense. She began to wonder if perhaps all this
was to teach her that she ought not to have gone away
from home? That she should have remained and borne
all there was to bear and just waited until relief came.
But at that her sound sense came to her rescue and she
began to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>She had passed into quite another section of the city
now, and trolleys were coming and going and plenty of
people on the streets. She boarded one of the cars and
rode until it came to a railroad station where she got off
and went in. There was a restaurant here where she
could get a glass of milk, and there was a rest room where
she might tidy herself and sit down and get her bearings.
She would study the time-tables and find out where to
go intelligently. This running away hit or miss might
only lead her in a circle and bring her back home before
night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>So she went in and asked some questions, finally buying
a ticket to a small town about a hundred miles away.
Half an hour later, she boarded the train, having added
to her crackers and cheese, an orange and a couple of
bananas for lunch.</p>

<p>It was a way train and slow, and Joyce curled up in
her seat and had a good, long nap, then woke to eat her
lunch and sleep again. She had thought to plan out a
campaign for herself, make some definite outline in her
mind of what she would do with the future so suddenly
opened out before her, but sleep simply dropped down
upon her and took possession. The strain under which
she had been, the sudden sharp emotions following one
upon the other had stretched her endurance almost to the
breaking point and relaxation brought such utter weariness
that she could not even think.</p>

<p>Something was the matter with the engine and they
stayed on a side track for a long time while men rushed
about shouting to one another and doing things to the
engine and now and again seemingly to the machinery
underneath the cars, but it all made no impression on
Joyce. She slept on, curled into a slim little heap in her
seat. After a long time a train came by from the other
direction, bringing aid perhaps, for it halted, and then
there were more poundings and shoutings, and at last
the train went on and Joyce&#8217;s train groaned and creaked
and took up its limping way, lumbering slowly on like
a person on crutches. About the middle of the afternoon,
they came to a halt, and Joyce, sitting up suddenly warned
by some inner consciousness, perceived she had arrived
at the place she had aimed for, and got out quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>She had been told in the city that there would be an
electric connection with another city, and sure enough,
there stood a rickety old trolley in which she embarked,
the only passenger for more than half the way.</p>

<p>Half an hour&#8217;s ride brought her through a lovely
rolling country, past country clubs, and estates, and into
the real farming district again, then more country clubs,
and scattering bungalows and cottages, till it seemed
evident that she was on the outskirts of a new suburb
of the city that was just being developed.</p>

<p>It might have been the pretty little church, covered
with vines and wearing the air of having been there
before the bungalows came, that gave her the sudden
impulse, or perhaps it was the well kept hedges and the
general atmosphere of hominess that pervaded the pleasant
streets. She decided to get out and see the place. She
was tired of travel in the stuffy, rickety old car, and at
least she could get into another car after she had walked a
while if she found no place that seemed livable.</p>

<p>She got out and followed down a pleasant shaded
street of homes, at first drinking in the beauty of the well
kept lawns and newly painted gardens and hedge rows,
turning corners and admiring bits of stone dwellings, bungalows,
all on one floor with charming variance of rough
stone pillars and porches. Turning two or three corners
thus, she came upon what seemed to be a large estate, an
old stone house far back from the road almost hidden by
wonderful trees and dense, clustering shrubbery. It had
the air of having been a fine old house of a time past, probably
the original estate from which the whole town had
been divided, and down at the corner in a little V of land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
where three roads came together and divided, the land
sloped from a high wall of hedge, with a tiny gravelled
path to the sidewalk, there stood the dearest little land
office that ever a developing operation dared to build. It
was not more than nine or ten feet long and six or seven
feet wide, but it had five windows and a door, and the tiniest
little front porch with a seat on each side as perfect and
complete as any little house that ever was built. A vine
had clambered over the portico and spread to cover one
entire end, and there were window boxes in the front
windows where flowers had grown the past year, though
weeds were overrunning them now.</p>

<p>As she drew nearer Joyce perceived that it had a
neglected air as if no one owned it or the owner was away
and didn&#8217;t care, and it seemed somehow so much like her
own forlorn self, hunting a home and a place in life, that
her heart went out to it wistfully.</p>

<p>Then strangest of all just as she was feeling that way
she turned the sharp point of the corner and saw two men
working about it at the back, and perceived one of them
raise a heavy implement and deal a tremendous blow at
the little dwelling sitting so cozily there on the little knoll,
with such a smiling, inviting air, doing its best to urge
people to buy lots and build in this pleasant town.</p>

<p>The little building shivered in all its timbers, and the
sound with which it reacted to the blow seemed something
between a groan and a sob. Joyce stood still with
horror in her eyes, and then the man raised the heavy
iron and swung it back for another blow.</p>

<p>But Joyce, without knowing what she was doing, was
all at once by his side:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried putting out a detaining hand upon
the exact spot where the iron must strike, &#8220;Oh! <i>Don&#8217;t!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The man paused in his motion and looked at her in
wonder, his iron on his shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he said astonished, &#8220;Did you speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joyce shyly, &#8220;Why are you doing that?
You will ruin the little house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Them was the boss&#8217; orders, ma&#8217;am. Wreck it. That&#8217;s
what I&#8217;m here for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;Why? It&#8217;s a perfectly good little house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to clear this here corner, ma&#8217;am, and set
the hedge out all the way around like the rest. He don&#8217;t
want no office here any more, he&#8217;s bought the place. He
said to get this out of the way the easiest way we knowed
how. I&#8217;m obeyin&#8217; orders, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man raised his arm for another blow and intimated
by his glance that he would be pleased if the lady
would move a little further away and give him more room
to strike. But Joyce only stepped nearer in her earnestness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he, do you think he might&mdash;perhaps&mdash;<i>sell</i>
it?&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another amusedly. This
was a queer, new kind of a girl. But they were dwellers
near a great city and there were all kinds in a city. Their
problem was to get rid of this one and go on with their
work as soon as possible. The second man took the
initiative:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; he said stepping up with authority, &#8220;The
boss is on his way to Europe an&#8217; we gotta git this here
building out o&#8217; this piece of ground before we quit tonight.
That&#8217;s my contract, an&#8217; I generally manage to keep my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
contrac&#8217;s. That&#8217;s how I keep my reputashun&mdash;gettin&#8217;
things done when I say I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce drew her brows together thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with this building?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Break her up an&#8217; cart her off. Got a man cornin&#8217;
in an hour to clean her up fer the kindlin&#8217; wood. We ain&#8217;t
got no time to waste, lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the house is yours? To do as you please
with?&#8221; Her eyes persisted, looking at the men earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, it amounts to that. Yas, it&#8217;s ourn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, wouldn&#8217;t you sell it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I tell you lady, the house has gotta git off&#8217;n
this here piece o&#8217; ground before tomorra mornin&#8217; &#8217;r I lose
my big contract on the rest o&#8217; this job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t it be moved?&#8221; persisted Joyce. &#8220;They
move houses even bigger than that. I&#8217;ve seen them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, yes, she could be moved. A course she could
be moved ef you had a place to put her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will get a place,&#8221; said Joyce decidedly. &#8220;What
will you sell the building for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The men looked at one another nonplussed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;d take five bucks apiece, wouldn&#8217;t we,
Tom?&#8221; said the older of the men winking slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;But she&#8217;s gotta get outta here
this arternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce looked anxiously about her as if she hoped to
find a bit of handy land close by:</p>

<p>&#8220;How much time have I?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
hunt a place. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s one somewhere. Do you
know where I could get a mover?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>The men grew interested. She really meant business.
Well, five bucks was five bucks of course, and if she really
wanted the house, why they didn&#8217;t mind earning double
money and getting a bit of a rest in the bargain. They
looked at each other again, a long meaningful glance:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Sam would fix her up, wouldn&#8217;t he, Tom?
I guess he wouldn&#8217;t overcharge her for movin&#8217;, would he?
He&#8217;s got the big jacks along today, ain&#8217;t he? An&#8217; she
ain&#8217;t very big&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think he would charge?&#8221; gasped Joyce
awaiting the answer as if her very life depended upon it.
It seemed as though she just couldn&#8217;t bear to lose that
little house! It seemed as though it had just been made
for her need, and she found her heart praying, &#8220;Oh,
heavenly Father, please make it possible, please make
it possible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he wouldn&#8217;t charge you much ef you didn&#8217;t go
too fur. But I don&#8217;t think you ken git enny land. It&#8217;s
all took up about here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much time will you give me?&#8221; asked Joyce
impatiently, anxiety growing in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we oughtta be pullin&#8217; out o&#8217; here in about a
nour,&#8221; said the older man. &#8220;The truck don&#8217;t leave fur a
nour an&#8217; a quarter. We&#8217;ll say a nour an&#8217; ten minutes.
That oughtta give you time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Joyce and flew down the street looking
about her on either side, and leaving the men gaping
after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all I gotta say is,&#8221; said Tom after gazing for
some minutes, &#8220;she&#8217;s some new kind of a nut! Do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
reckon to wait fer her to come back, er shall I go on bustin&#8217;
her up?&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man dropped down comfortably on the grass
and took out his pipe. &#8220;A bargain&#8217;s a bargain, Tom,&#8221;
he said cupping his hands around the match, &#8220;I allus keeps
my contrac&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; said Tom, dropping stiffly beside him, &#8220;But
sposen she don&#8217;t come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll come back,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;But sposen she can&#8217;t find no land?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my opinion, Tom, that she&#8217;s one o&#8217; them kind,
that ef she can&#8217;t find no land she&#8217;ll <i>make</i> a little bit. I&#8217;ve
seen &#8217;em before, an&#8217; they can bamboozle the eye teeth out
of a tightwad ef they really try. She&#8217;s really tryin&#8217; now.
She wants this here cottage bad, an&#8217; I intend she&#8217;ll have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom squinted his eyes and observed his chief thoughtfully
remarking after a while:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pretty soon the chief arose, took up his implements
of work and went up to the little house. He studied the
foundation for a few moments and then he began with
his pick to work about it, loosening the stones in which
it was set. Tom arose and followed him, watching his
movements a moment. Then he raised his eyes to the
side of the little structure as if for the first time he observed
it as a dwelling, a housing place for a human being.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a purty vine,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;too bad it
has to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to die,&#8221; said the chief. &#8220;We&#8217;re agoin&#8217;
to save it. Where&#8217;s that there big lard kettle we bed
around here? See ef it&#8217;s inside the hedge.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Tom foraged behind the hedge and brought a battered
tin can.</p>

<p>The chief dug carefully about the roots of the vine,
in a good-sized circle, dug it deeply and neatly and together
they lifted the roots of the vine with the earth
firmly about it, and fitted it into the lard kettle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll hev to work it so&#8217;s this here don&#8217;t git
disturbed when we move her,&#8221; said the chief.</p>

<p>Tom found a bit of board and some nails among their
tools behind the hedge, and made a little shelf on the side
of the building upon which they set the can, nailing it
firmly to the house so that it would not be disturbed.</p>

<p>Then with deep satisfaction the two set about preparing
the building for its removal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> had walked for three blocks in frantic haste
with sinking heart before she saw any land that looked
at all promising. They were all smug dwellings with beautiful
lawns about them, and she had sense enough to know
that people who lived in houses of that kind wanted their
lawns to themselves, and could not be persuaded to sell
or rent even a foot for any such sum as she could offer.
But the turn of the next block brought in sight a row
of neat stores and just beyond an old-fashioned house set
back from the street built of field stone that looked as if
it had stood there years before the little new town had
ever been heard of. It was neat and trim with a wide
piazza the length of the front, and tall spruce and hemlock
trees standing in a friendly group about it. There was
a street running across between it and the stores, and on
this side yard there was a bright garden of flowers and
a grassy place with two maple trees just far enough apart
to let her little house in, and here Joyce paused and looked
with longing eyes. If only she could get permission to
put her house here. If she could have it between those
maples, with the right to use the side gate! And there
was an outside faucet with a hose attached. They might
let her get water there&mdash;!</p>

<p>She stood for several minutes taking in the whole
situation. It would be nice to have the protection of a
house near by provided nice people lived there. It would
be around at the back of the house so the owners would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
not need to feel they were losing any of their own front
yard, or privacy, and it was near enough to the street so
that she would feel she had a spot of her own.</p>

<p>It was like Joyce not to hunt up any land agent and
try to find a place in the conventional way but to just fasten
her eyes upon the desirable spot and then go after it.</p>

<p>Timidly she opened the gate and went in, choosing
the side gate instead of the front. It was unusual to
have a gate. That was because it was an old-fashioned
house. She was glad there was a gate. It made her
feel as if she would be more secure in a little house all by
herself to have a gate shutting her in. But this was too
much like a fairy tale. She must not get up her hopes.
Of course these people wouldn&#8217;t hear to her request. They
would think she was crazy perhaps to dare to ask.</p>

<p>There was some one in the diningroom setting the
table. The door was open on a side porch, and she could
see as she went up the steps that the table was long, and
spread with a white cloth, and there were flowers in the
middle in a glass bowl, blue violets, quantities of them.
The door beyond was open through an airy pantry to a
kitchen, and there was a savory odor of broiling meat.
She sniffed it hungrily as she put out a timid hand to
knock, and thought anxiously that it must be getting late
if some one was getting dinner ready so early.</p>

<p>A pleasant-looking woman with her hair in crimping
pins over her forehead and a long, plain gingham apron
covering her dress came to the door with a tea towel
and a glass in her hand, polishing as she came. Joyce
almost lost her voice at the thought of her own audacity
while she looked into the pleasant gray eyes of the elderly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
woman. This was just the kind of woman she would
have chosen if the fairy tale were real. But she remembered
that ten minutes of her hour were already gone,
and she must hurry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just stopped in to see if there is any possibility
that I could rent, or perhaps buy, a very few feet of your
yard, here at the back. I have a little house and I want
to put it somewhere right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A house!&#8221; said the woman astonished. &#8220;Why no,
we don&#8217;t want to sell any land. This place has been in
the family for four generations and it&#8217;ll go on to my son
when he comes of age. He&#8217;s only in high school yet,
but he&#8217;s fond of the old place, and we don&#8217;t want to give
up any more land. We&#8217;ve just got about enough. My
husband wouldn&#8217;t think of selling any, not even a foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you rent a little spot? It&#8217;s a very little house.
I could put it quite close to the fence if it was necessary,
and away at the back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy, no!&#8221; said the woman, &#8220;We like our privacy.
We wouldn&#8217;t want another house so close. It&#8217;s bad enough
to have all those stores across the street. My husband
wouldn&#8217;t have sold that land if he&#8217;d known they were going
to build stores&mdash;Mercy! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman had turned with a start of horror, for a
flash of light had blazed up from the kitchen that flickered
over the room like a sudden illumination, and a pungent
odor of burning meat filled the air at the same instant.
Strange what a short interval there is between cooking
and actual burning, and what a sudden odor burnt meat
can impart to a room. The place was filled with it.</p>

<p>Joyce was standing so that she could see straight into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
the kitchen range and she saw exactly what was the matter.
There were flames bursting out from the cracks of
the gas range oven, and flames lighting up the seams of
the broiling oven. Having had the same thing happen
to herself once when she was cooking she understood just
what had occurred. Without more ceremony she threw
the screen door open and walked in, straight through
into the kitchen. While the owner of the calm eyes was
hurrying distractedly about the kitchen seeking for the
pie lifter and a holder, Joyce quickly turned out the gas
under the oven, and threw open the lower door. It was
as she supposed, there was grease and drippings from
the broiling chops in the pan below the broiler and it had
caught on fire and was blazing high. It was of no use
to try to smother it out or to save the chops. They were
burned to a crisp already and the kitchen was filling fast
with a black, oozy soot that was fastening to every immaculate
pot and pan and to the wall and ceiling.</p>

<p>The gray-eyed woman moaned, for the chops were
many and expensive and she was preparing for a company
dinner. Then her despair was changed to terror as she
saw the flames shoot out into the room bringing dense,
black smoke with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better call the Fire Company!&#8221; she gasped and
turned toward the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Wait!&#8221; gasped Joyce amid the smoke, &#8220;Give
me that bread blanket! Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman seized the thick, soft woollen cloth that
lay tucked snugly about three pans of biscuits on the
table and Joyce swathed her hands in its folds and courageously
gripping the broiling pan, broiler, chops and all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
carried them flaming to the back door and flung them
out into the grass.</p>

<p>It was all done in a second and the two stood in the
doorway and watched the conquered fire flash up a few
times and go out. Then the woman turned to the girl:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wonderful!&#8221; she said earnestly, &#8220;I can&#8217;t
thank you enough. I don&#8217;t know what I should have done
if I&#8217;d been alone. I never could have carried that out
all afire that way. I don&#8217;t see how you did it. And you
got burned! I&#8217;ll bet you did! Yes, and there on your arm
too. That&#8217;s too bad! Now come over here and I&#8217;ll do it
up. I&#8217;ve got some sweet oil and linen&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears of pain were stinging into Joyce&#8217;s eyes but
she shook her head and tried to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t time to wait.
I&#8217;ll just put it in cold water a minute to take the smart
out, and then if you have some baking soda I&#8217;ll cover it
up and it&#8217;ll be all right. It&#8217;s not much of a burn anyway,
and it was my fault your meat burned. If I hadn&#8217;t hindered
you, you wouldn&#8217;t have forgotten it. I&#8217;m afraid
you were going to have company too. I think I ought to
pay for that meat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it wasn&#8217;t your fault. I ought not to have
left that grease in the pan. I knew it was there and I
just forgot it. But I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do
about the chops. It&#8217;s Wednesday afternoon and all the
stores are closed. My company comes on the five o&#8217;clock
train, my cousins from New York on their way up from
Florida, and they&#8217;re only going to stop over till the nine
o&#8217;clock train. I don&#8217;t see them very often and I&#8217;d like to
have a little something extra, and now I don&#8217;t know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
I am going to do. I shouldn&#8217;t have broiled them so long
beforehand only I wanted to get the smell out of the house
before the folks came, and I knew I could keep them warm
in the warming oven all right. Now what in time am I
going to do for meat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got anything at all in the house?&#8221; asked
Joyce turning from dusting her burns with soda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but some ham. Got plenty of that on hand,
bought a whole one the other day, but one doesn&#8217;t want
to give New York City folks fried ham for dinner. That&#8217;s
kind of farm food. I wanted a little something nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever bake it in milk?&#8221; asked Joyce, wishing
she knew some way to help the woman for she understood
her distress and felt that she was really to blame for
having bothered her when she was busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never tried it. I&#8217;ve heard some say they cook
it that way, but I don&#8217;t know how. Do you? I don&#8217;t
see how that would be any different from stewed ham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but it is! It&#8217;s delectable. If you can get the
things quickly I&#8217;ll fix it for you. You&#8217;ve just about time
if you want dinner at five. It has to bake an hour. Have
you plenty of milk? And mustard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loads of milk. We have a cow, and mustard too,
but what do you want with mustard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Joyce. &#8220;Cut the ham in thick
slices, as much as you want. My! That&#8217;s nice ham, nice
and pink looking and good and big. How many people?
Yes, I guess you need two slices. Can I use these two
iron frying pans? I think it bakes best in iron. You
light the oven please, turn it on full power. Now, see, I
take a handful of mustard and rub it into the meat, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
over thickly, and put it into the pan. Then fill it up with
milk till it almost covers the meat. Put it into the oven
and bake it just an hour, a good hot oven, and it will be
the sweetest, tenderest thing you ever put into your mouth.
There, there&#8217;s just room enough for both pans, and you
needn&#8217;t worry about meat. They&#8217;ll like that I know. I
found the recipe in an advertisement of ham in a magazine
and I tried it. Everybody loves it. Now I must go,
but I just wish I could wait and help you to make up for
spoiling those chops. You don&#8217;t know anywhere I could
go that they would rent me a piece of land, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, I don&#8217;t just know, but suppose you wait
till tomorrow morning and my husband may know of
something. He might be able to find you just the right
thing. If you&#8217;d be willing to stay and help me here a little
while I&#8217;d pay you well and I&#8217;d help you with all my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce smiled sorrowfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be too late. I&#8217;ve got to have a place
within a few minutes now or I&#8217;ll lose the house. The
man said they couldn&#8217;t wait but an hour and ten minutes
and I must have used up more than three-quarters of it
now. I&#8217;d love to stay and help you, and if I can possibly
get through what I have to do I&#8217;ll come back and help
you. Perhaps I could get here in time to wait on the table
if you&#8217;d like me. I wouldn&#8217;t want any pay. I feel as if
I owed you something. But I just can&#8217;t stay now. I must
save this little house. It&#8217;s the only place I could ever hope
to have for a home that I could afford, and I&#8217;ve really
bought it, so I <i>must</i> find a place to put it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake! Bought a house and must have
a place to put it right away. Why, I never heard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
anything so unreasonable. Couldn&#8217;t you buy the land
it was on? Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the man wants to clear his land. When I came on
them they were breaking it up into kindling wood, and it&#8217;s
the dearest little place, just big enough for one. It&#8217;s about
four blocks away from here on the edge of a big place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! The Land Office. That <i>is</i> pretty. Yes, I heard
some one had bought that old house and was going to fix
it up. Why&mdash;but that&#8217;s not a house. It&#8217;s only a room.
That wouldn&#8217;t take up much room. I should think most
anybody would be willing to let you have enough land for
that. If that&#8217;s all maybe papa wouldn&#8217;t mind. He
wouldn&#8217;t sell any land but he might rent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Joyce clasping her hands eagerly, &#8220;Where
can I find him? I&#8217;ll go right away. Perhaps I&#8217;ll be in
time if I hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, you can&#8217;t find him anywhere. He&#8217;s gone
to the city. He won&#8217;t be home till the folks come. He
went to meet them. But if you&#8217;re in such a hurry as all
that I suppose you could bring your house here for the
night anyway, and then we could see about it tomorrow.
About how much were you figuring to pay? Could you
pay as much as a dollar a week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think so,&#8221; said Joyce relieved, &#8220;I&#8217;m expecting
to get a position right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can bring it here tonight and if it doesn&#8217;t
look too much in the way we&#8217;ll try it. Our missionary
society is getting up a fund to get some chime bells for
our church, and each one of us has to earn some extra
money some way. If I choose to earn mine by giving up
a piece of the back yard my husband won&#8217;t object. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
house is really mine anyway. You can come and try it
and we won&#8217;t promise anything on either side till we see
how it goes. Now. Can&#8217;t you hurry right back and
help me. I&#8217;m almost distracted with all there is to do,
and I&#8217;m all shaken up with that fire and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly will,&#8221; said Joyce with almost a shout of
glee in her voice, as she turned and fairly flew back the
four blocks to her little house, straining her eyes as she
came nearer to make sure it still stood whole and fair
before her. Yes, there it was, all vine clad. How dear
and sweet. But the vine would have to go of course. It
could not survive. What a pity. Of course those men
would think that was all nonsense. If she only had a little
time perhaps she might have managed to get the root loose
and maybe it would live, but there wasn&#8217;t time and she
mustn&#8217;t think of it. She must hurry, hurry back to
that woman who had been so good, and help her with all
her might.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a comin&#8217;,&#8221; growled Tom as the sound of her
swift footsteps drew near, &#8220;an&#8217; she don&#8217;t sound discouraged
neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d I tell ye?&#8221; growled the other. &#8220;The hour
ain&#8217;t up fer ten minutes yet neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe she&#8217;s comin&#8217; to ask fer more time,&#8221; urged
Tom squinting down the street speculatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;she wouldn&#8217;t come till the time
was up to the minute ef that was it. Anyhow, look at her!
She&#8217;s ashinin&#8217; like a robin just back fer spring. That
ain&#8217;t no discouragin&#8217; countenance, ur my name ain&#8217;t
McClatchey.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>The big auto truck was just lumbering around the
corner as Joyce arrived panting and triumphant:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found a nice place,&#8221; she said joyously, &#8220;just
down this street three blocks, and one around the corner.
It&#8217;s opposite the side of a row of stores, just beyond the
stores on the side street. There&#8217;s a fence, but I thought
perhaps you could back right up to it and slide the house
over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely we kin,&#8221; said the boss filling his pipe
speculatively, and straightening up to await the truck.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Ain&#8217;t ya got the kindlin&#8217; ready to pile on
yet, boys? It&#8217;s most quittin&#8217; time now. You said&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your clack!&#8221; commanded the chief. &#8220;This
here is a house, it ain&#8217;t no load o&#8217; kindlin&#8217; wood. You
made a mistake. I&#8217;ve sold this here buildin&#8217; an&#8217; it&#8217;s gotta
be delivered to oncet. You clamber down, Sam, an&#8217; git
them jacks an&#8217; rollers from behind that hedge, an&#8217;
get busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me how much it will be?&#8221; asked Joyce
anxiously remembering that this was a momentous question
and might yet present an impossible barrier to her
plans. She looked from the driver to the chief in a
troubled way, and the chief spoke up gruffly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you kin give him five bucks too ef you want
fer keepin&#8217; his tongue still, but he has to do what I say,
and I say this here house is goin&#8217; to be moved t&#8217;night.
Look out there Sam, don&#8217;t you knock that there hangin&#8217;
garding off&#8217;n the end. That&#8217;s a part of the proposishun,
an&#8217; don&#8217;t wantta be destroyed. Get me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Joyce, quite childishly clapping her hands.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve saved the vine! Oh, thank you so much!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the chief, &#8220;sold it to you, didn&#8217;t I? Part
o&#8217; the house, ain&#8217;t it? I &#8217;low to keep my contrac&#8217;s. Now,
you kin run &#8217;long, an&#8217; be on the spot when we git thar to
say where you want her put. This ain&#8217;t no place fer a girl
while we&#8217;re movin&#8217; her, you might git hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I pay you first?&#8221; she asked opening her little
handbag.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the chief quite crossly, &#8220;don&#8217;t take no
pay till we deliver the goods. Down across from the
stores you say? Stone house? Picket fence? Yep. I
know the place. Ain&#8217;t but one picket fence in the place.
Folks wouldn&#8217;t sell an inch of ground. You&#8217;re lucky!
But then ennybody kin see you&#8217;re that kind. Run along.
We&#8217;ll be along in a leetle while. You needn&#8217;t to worry.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On winged</span> feet Joyce retraced her steps and entered
the diningroom she had left a few minutes before as
eagerly as if it were her own home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I could come back right away,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;The men have the truck all ready and said they would be
along in a little while, and oh, I&#8217;m so thankful to you.
Now, what can I do first?</p>

<p>&#8220;I could see you were a little troubled about that ham,
never having tasted it cooked that way. Is there anything
else we could make to help make up for the chops? Or
couldn&#8217;t I go somewhere and find the butcher and ask
him to let me have some more for you. I&#8217;d pay for
them myself, because I really burned them up you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a dear child,&#8221; said the woman pleasantly.
&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t find the butcher. He&#8217;s taken his
wife up in the country for the afternoon, and he&#8217;s cross
as two sticks anyway. Besides, I wouldn&#8217;t want him
to know I had been so careless, and it&#8217;s none of his business
anyway. But I was thinking if there was something
else I could make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you on hand? Let&#8217;s look in the
refrigerator,&#8221; suggested the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. There&#8217;s some cold chicken. I was saving
it for Jim and he didn&#8217;t come home at noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hurried to the refrigerator and took out a bowl
which Joyce examined.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s half a breast and a drumstick, and both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
wings. There&#8217;s the gizzard too. Why don&#8217;t we make
some chicken salad. Have you any celery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I bought a stalk the other day. I like the top
leaves to flavor bean soup, but there isn&#8217;t much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little will do. I see you have some tomatoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Jim likes them. I say they aren&#8217;t very tasty
this time of year, not worth the money, but Jim always
asks for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t we stuff them with chicken salad?
That would make a beautiful salad dish and make the
chicken go farther. Didn&#8217;t I see lettuce in the garden? A
few leaves will do even if it isn&#8217;t very big. And how
about mayonnaise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I make a boiled mayonnaise, but it&#8217;s late to get
it cool, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any oil? That makes it so much nicer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Parsons brought over a can she had left
when they moved away last week. There&#8217;s pretty near
a pint in it, just had a few spoonsful taken out, but I can&#8217;t
make real mayonnaise. It won&#8217;t get stiff for me. It separates.
And it takes so long, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can. No, it only takes a few minutes. I
know a lovely recipe. Where&#8217;s the oil? Get me some
salt and pepper and mustard and eggs. I&#8217;ll have it ready
in a jiffy while you cut up the celery and chicken. Then
we&#8217;ll fix it and put it on the ice all ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two were soon busily at work, and the mayonnaise
whipped itself into a thick, velvety, yellow mass in no time
under Joyce&#8217;s skilful hand. The worried hostess was delighted,
and presently a tempting platter of scarlet tomatoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
was set on the ice, filled to overflowing with the most
toothsome chicken salad that ever went to a feast.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to have creamed potatoes and new
peas out of your own garden. Isn&#8217;t that wonderful?
What&#8217;s for dessert? Anything I can do about that?&#8221;
asked Joyce as she turned away from the refrigerator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve ordered ice cream, and I made a cake.
That&#8217;s all right, I just looked at it and the icing is hardening
nicely. You see I just got the telegram at three o&#8217;clock
that they were coming. It went first to the other Bryants
up on the hill and they were away. I ought to have got
it yesterday. I wonder why that ice cream doesn&#8217;t come.
They promised to have it here at four. I always order
it earlier than I need it for safety. It&#8217;s twenty after four
now. I believe I&#8217;ll call up to make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the phone and in two or three minutes
appeared in the kitchen door where Joyce was just putting
on the peas, with her face the picture of dismay:</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do? They can&#8217;t send it. They say the
orders have all gone out this afternoon, and mine wasn&#8217;t
among them. There was some mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there some other place? I&#8217;ll run out and get
some for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant in despair, &#8220;the other two
places don&#8217;t have any fit to eat. I wouldn&#8217;t offer it to
a cat! I haven&#8217;t even a pie on hand. Isn&#8217;t this simply
awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor woman sat down and dropped her tired face
in her hands looking as if she were going to weep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry, Mrs. Bryant. There&#8217;s always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
something one can do. Let me think. Have you any
junket tablets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said the despairing housekeeper, &#8220;But
what is junket? An invalid&#8217;s food!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till you see mine. It&#8217;s caramel junket, and
we&#8217;ll serve it with whipped cream. You haven&#8217;t some preserved
cherries or a few strawberries or something to put
on the top of each dish, have you? It&#8217;s the prettiest thing
you ever saw. Where is the sugar, quick? We must
hurry. Have you some individual dishes that will be
pretty to hold it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryant produced some long stemmed sherbet
glasses and a bottle of preserved cherries, saying dubiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll never cool. It&#8217;s way after four now.&#8221; But
she watched the deft fingers as they manipulated the sugar
over the flame, until it had reached the right perfection
of caramel color and was stirred fizzing into the lukewarm
milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t set,&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant, &#8220;mine never does
except in real cold weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes it will. I put in an extra tablet to hurry it,&#8221;
said Joyce. &#8220;Now, I want some cream. Can I take it
off those two bottles? It looks rich enough to whip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it whips I guess,&#8221; sighed the woman, &#8220;but I
never can get time for such frills. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve
decided to sell the cow, it took so much time to tend to the
milk. It&#8217;s really sold, but the man isn&#8217;t coming for it till
next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce worked breathlessly, one eye on the clock, and
all the while her heart watching for a little house to come
riding down the street, yet the time went by and no house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
appeared. Could it be that the men had gone back on
their word, or that they had made a mistake and taken
it to the wrong street, or that something had happened
to the precious little structure on the way?</p>

<p>The junket &#8220;set&#8221; and the cream whipped in spite
of the anxiety of Mrs. Bryant, and at ten minutes to five
both were on the ice, and the cherries were on a plate
with a fork near by to place them on their setting of
whipped cream at the proper moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better go and get ready yourself now,&#8221; said
Joyce smiling, as she lifted the potatoes and poured them
through the colander, setting them to steam dry for a
moment before creaming them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see to the peas, and
the ham is just perfect. I&#8217;ll have it all on the platter ready
to take in and keep it hot. You don&#8217;t happen to have a
white apron you could lend me, do you? That is, if you
want me to wait on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, will you? I&#8217;d be so glad. I&#8217;m always nervous
with city folks. Yes, I&#8217;ve got an apron. I&#8217;ll throw it
down the back stairs. And I&#8217;ll just run up and change
now, and smooth my hair. It won&#8217;t take a minute. They
ought to be here any time now. I&#8217;m real relieved. I think
things are going to be all right. If you have time you
might cut the cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce, wearied almost to the limit, yet interested in
what she was doing and eager to serve one who had so
served her, turned back and put all the last little touches on
the table that she well knew how to put, smoothed her
own pretty hair as well as she could with only the tiny
comb with which her handbag was fitted, washed her
face and hands at the sink, and took off the big gingham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
apron Mrs. Bryant had loaned, to replace it with the white
one that presently fluttered down the back stairs. She
giggled to herself to think what a change had come over
her life in twenty-four hours. Here she was at almost
the same hour getting supper in another kitchen for an
entirely different set of people, utter strangers. How
strange and interesting! How wonderful to have the
opportunity to thus work her way into a bit of land for
her house! How kind of the Heavenly Father to fix it all
for her! How good it was that she could cook, and had
the ability to help in this time of need!</p>

<p>But there was no time to meditate. The kitchen clock
was striking with a business-like clang, and the honk of
an automobile horn could be heard coming down the
street. Mrs. Bryant rustled down in a gray cr&ecirc;pe dress
and her hair fluffed up becomingly. Her eyes were bright
and her cheeks wore a pretty little touch of nervous color
as she looked out the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they are coming!&#8221; she said eagerly, and then
Joyce glancing out behind her saw looming clumsily in the
distance, blocking up the street and grown to most enormous
proportions, her little vine clad office riding down
behind the bright little car that was speeding rapidly toward
the Bryant gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Bryant!&#8221; breathed Joyce in alarm, &#8220;My
house is coming too, and you haven&#8217;t told me where to
put it yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your house?&#8221; said the preoccupied lady half impatiently,
&#8220;Oh, yes. Why, put it anywhere you like for
tonight. Just don&#8217;t get into the garden. You won&#8217;t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to go out and see to it, will you? Because I can&#8217;t spare
you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for a second,&#8221; said Joyce happily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
to pay the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, wait till the meat is on the table and everything
passed. Don&#8217;t forget the coffee. There they are.
Now I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce, starry-eyed, tired to death but smiling, began
to take up the dinner and carry it into the diningroom.
She could hear the hum of voices in greeting, the people
going upstairs, the splashing of water as the guests made
rapid toilets, and all the time her senses were listening
for the coming of the truck and trying to time her
actions so that she might go out and tell the men where
to put the house, and yet not interfere with any of her
duties as waitress.</p>

<p>She flew out at last while the guests were being seated
and told the chief about where she thought the house
should stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go right in,&#8221; she said confidingly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
helping Mrs. Bryant with a dinner. She has company,
and they&#8217;re going to catch a train, but you can put it right
in there between those two trees, wherever it is convenient
to you. Just so it keeps out of the garden. I suppose
I&#8217;ll have to get some one to fix it steady, won&#8217;t I? I&#8217;ll
be out again in a few minutes if you need me for anything,&#8221;
and she flew in again, and straightening her white
apron entered the diningroom with a plate of hot biscuits.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryant was a meek, apologetic little man with a
retreating chin and kind eyes. He half arose when he
saw Joyce as if he thought this was another guest that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
had somehow got misplaced, but Mrs. Bryant incorporated
her at once into the picture with a glance that placed
her as a server, and Mr. Bryant slid back into his chair,
his mouth the shape of an inaudible O, and addressed
himself to this new and mysterious kind of ham that
looked like roast veal and cut like chicken.</p>

<p>The guests exclaimed with delight over their food.
They said they had lived in hotels all winter and it was
just wonderful to get back to home cooking again, and
what wonderful ham! Was it really ham, just HAM?
And how did she do it? Could she give them the recipe?
And then Joyce as she came and went with relays of hot
biscuits and peas and potatoes heard Mrs. Bryant tell carefully
how she rubbed the mustard into the meat, etc.,
through all the performance just as she had done it, and
finish up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we think it is the best way in the world to
cook ham,&#8221; just as if she had been doing it that way all
her life. She smiled to herself over the salad as she arranged
the ice cold tomatoes on the crisp lettuce leaves.
Well, it was a pretty dinner and she was proud to think
she had helped make it so. The poor burnt chops were
utterly forgotten now, lying in the grass at the kitchen
door, and sometime within the next few hours she would
get a chance to sit down, perhaps to lie down, somewhere,
on the grass if nowhere else, and rest. Oh, that would
be wonderful!</p>

<p>She took the plates out and brought in the salad, adding
some crackers she had found in the pantry, and then
slipped out to see what the men were doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a very superior waitress you seem to have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Aunt Mattie,&#8221; remarked a niece, eyeing the door through
which Joyce had passed, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to let me steal
her and take her up to New York do you? I&#8217;d certainly
give a good deal to get one that looked like that. She
seems a real lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant shortly, &#8220;She&#8217;s not a
waitress at all. She&#8217;s just a neighbor who came in to help
me so that I could have all my time with you instead of
running out to the kitchen all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something innately, grimly honest about
Mattie Bryant. She might claim the credit of a well-cooked
ham, but she would never let a young girl who had
been kind to her be treated like a servant. It wasn&#8217;t in
her. She would have liked to have posed as having well-trained
servants, but she couldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;A-a neighbor, did you say, mother?&#8221; asked Mr.
Bryant, &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t seem to remember her. Where
does she live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I guess you don&#8217;t, father, she&#8217;s mostly been here
when you were away. She lives on this street. Cornelia,
won&#8217;t you have another cup of coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then there came a shuddering, sliding sound, and
a dull, reverberating thud, that vibrated along the floor,
and seemed to make the dinner table shiver a tiny bit
and everybody looked up and said, &#8220;Why, what is that?
An earthquake?&#8221; and only Mrs. Bryant kept her cool
indifference, and went on pouring coffee. But outside
the little vine covered house had slid into place between
the two maples, and settled to rest exactly where it had
been aimed by the three men who had put it there, and
Joyce was out in the sunset fluttering three five dollar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
bills from her precious hoard and smiling her wistful,
wild rose smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could give you ten times as much,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;If I only had it! You&#8217;ve been so kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old chief stood a minute and watched her as she
went in, looked at the bill, half folded it to put in his
pocket, thought better of it and stepped inside the building.
He glanced about, fumbled a pin from the lapel of
his old coat and pinned it up on the wall opposite the
door. Tom watched him from a distance, squinting his
eyes thoughtfully, busied himself with his dinnerpail
and pickaxe till the chief was around the corner, when
he slipped into the cottage, took a look around, stood
thoughtful a minute and deliberately took out his own
five dollar bill and pinned it beside the other. Then he
went out quickly and followed his chief down the street.</p>

<p>Over in the kitchen Joyce, too weary to eat much supper
had taken a bite and gone at the dishes pell mell. She
was a swift worker and used to turning things off rapidly,
but the last two days had been more strenuous than any
in her short life, and now that the immediate excitement
of the dinner and the house were over, she was beginning
to feel that she had reached her limit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryant slipped away from her guests long enough
to smile upon her, and tell her to eat a good supper, that
everything was wonderful, and she couldn&#8217;t thank her
enough; then went back to the parlor where the chatter
of relatives long separated with many years to check up
in a short time made a din almost amounting to a church
social. There was the uncle who had certain jokes that
he had to tell over, and the cousin who boasted, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
cousin who wanted to recount all the past, and the aunt
who wanted to forget the past and dilate on her house in
New York, and her place in Maine, and her winter in
Florida and the trip she was going to take abroad this
summer, and with it all the poor, eager little Bryants
hardly got in a word. The strange young woman in the
kitchen might naturally be forgotten under such circumstances,
especially as they were planning to take all their
guests into the city in time for the late train.</p>

<p>So Joyce washed out the dish towels and slipped out
the back door with only the moon to light her to her little
new house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> wondered, as she went cautiously through the
grass lest she stumble in the darkness, whether her house
was going to be at all habitable, and what she should
do if it were not. She had no mind to trouble Mrs.
Bryant any further, neither did she care to have that
good woman know how thoroughly she was adrift in the
world without a spot to lay her head. Very likely Mrs.
Bryant might offer her a bed for the night, it would be
like her good nature, and yet, she was an utter stranger,
and she shrank from accepting such a favor. Taking
an entire stranger into one&#8217;s home was a big thing to
do, when one had no introduction whatever except that
one could cook.</p>

<p>She had had no time to look out at her new purchase
while it was being placed, and now was not even sure they
had set it evenly on its floor. It might be on end or
toppled onto its roof for aught she knew, and when this
thought presented itself she walked on in a growing dismay.
But the street light just opposite proved a boon
and shone right between the two trees to the little white
building which was nestled all properly on a level spot,
floor down, and even as a die, with its little front porch
facing the street and set back about fifteen feet from the
fence. When she put her hand on the porch rail it seemed
to be standing solidly. She could see, on stooping down,
that it was set on some stones with fresh cement. The
men had taken trouble to make it right and firm for her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
How kind they were! She must try and hunt them up
tomorrow and thank them. Then she remembered the
vine and tired as she was stepped around to see how it
had fared on its journey. Behold it had been taken out of
its lard can and set in the ground! They had even found
some water and watered it, for drops were glistening on
the leaves and an empty tin can lay on the ground. Somehow
it brought sudden tears to think that these two
rough men had taken so much pains to set out the vine
for her, a stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just God,&#8221; she said to herself as she went back
to the front porch, &#8220;God is taking care of me!&#8221; Then
she lifted her eyes to the stars and said in a soft voice as
she stood on her own little step, &#8220;Dear Father in Heaven,
bless this little house, and me, and take care of me here
for Christ&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>It occurred to her as she turned toward the door that
it might be locked and then where would she find a key
to fit it? But the knob turned and the door opened without
any trouble and she stepped inside and closed it
softly after her. For a moment she could see nothing.
Then her eyes became accustomed to the semi-darkness,
and the patches of light on the floor that came through
the little diamond panes of the windows and door showed
the room to be empty save for a wooden box in the
middle of the floor, and a great stack of newspapers in
one corner.</p>

<p>Joyce had brought a few matches with her from Mrs.
Bryant&#8217;s and now she struck one and looked around carefully.
The place was tolerably clean. The floor was
dusty of course and a few peanut shells were scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
here and there, but nothing very bad. The walls were
lined with compo board and painted white, and in the
flare of a few matches presented no unpleasant features.
The box was empty and the pile of newspapers seemed
to be different lots left over from some newsstand. They
were of old dates, folded but once, and quite clean. There
did not even seem to be any spider webs in that corner,
and only the top papers were dusty.</p>

<p>Having satisfied herself so far she deposited the remaining
matches on the window sill for a possible time
of need in the night and set to work. Those newspapers
were her only chance, and she was thankful for them.
She must make a bed out of them.</p>

<p>Her first act was to drag the box across the floor
to block the door. There was no key and she had no
mind to sleep in a strange place, with a door that could
be opened by any one in the night. The box was just
high enough to reach under the knob, and heavy enough
so that the door could not be opened without making a
good deal of noise; and after she had placed it she felt
quite secure in her new shelter.</p>

<p>She covered the top of the box with a clean newspaper
and put her hat and handbag upon them. Then she
attacked the pile of newspapers. She unfolded them sheet
by sheet and crumpled them thoroughly, throwing them
into the corner and when she had covered a space on the
floor about six feet long by three feet wide with these
crumpled papers crowded close together, she laid several
open sheets smoothly over them tucking the edges well
underneath, and began again crumpling papers and putting
on the top another layer. These in turn had several whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
newspapers laid smoothly on the top and then another layer
until she had quite a comfortable couch of springy paper.
She even opened out a couple of papers and filled them with
crumpled pieces for a pillow.</p>

<p>There were still plenty of newspapers left and she
spread them out overlapping one another in layers, until
she had a coverlet of good proportions. Then she folded
their edges back to hold them together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t freeze if it turns cold in the night,&#8221;
she thought gleefully.</p>

<p>Next she went to her little new windows and wrestled
with them. They were casements, swinging in, but it
required much pounding and pulling to make them swing
at all at first. At last she had them all open wide letting
in the sweet night air. She looked out into the dark
garden a trifle dubiously, it is true. It did seem a little
uncanny to sleep there alone with windows wide and the
street so close, with not even a curtain to shelter her, but
she must have air and there was nothing else to be done.
She must just wake up early in the morning before folks
were astir. Curtains were among the first things she must
purchase. Of course there were the newspapers, but they
would shut out the air.</p>

<p>She knelt for a moment beside the wooden box in the
path of moonlight that came through her window and
prayed for strength and guidance. It seemed a strange
thing she was doing, now that she had done it, this buying
a little house and daring to set up a home of her own on
practically no money at all. A sense of awe was upon her as
she brought her deed before God and tried to see it in
the light of His wisdom. Had she done wrong to fly off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
at the unpleasant words of her cousin and seek a new
environment? Somehow her soul rang true, however, as
she cast once more a retrospective glance back and asked
approval and guarding. She seemed so alone as she knelt
there in the little empty room in the moonlight. Aunt
Mary gone. The death angel standing ever between them
and the dear old life they had lived together; the home
town with its dear friends who loved her and whom she
loved, forever lost to her because of the presence there
of the cousins who had nothing in common with her and
who were possessed to spoil everything she tried to do;
were jealous of all her communication with the old friends.
There was simply no one or nothing left but God, and
she must cling close to Him.</p>

<p>She glanced out her little open window as she rose
from her knees, and dismay seized upon her as she heard
footsteps coming along the pavement. The street was so
near. It was almost as if she were standing in the way
of the oncomer. She held her breath and the steps paused
for a full minute in front of the new little house in its
strange setting, and she shivered nervously as they finally
passed on.</p>

<p>Then there came to her mind, as if a sweet voice had
spoken, the old words she had learned with Aunt Mary
one Sunday afternoon long years ago:</p>

<p>&#8220;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them
that fear Him and delivereth them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will both lay me down in peace and sleep, for thou
Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crept into her strange, rattling couch and drew
the crackling coverlet up about her, laid her head upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
her rattley pillow and closed her weary eyes, resting her
heart upon the words of the book as upon a pillow of peace.
Then suddenly, without warning, the tears came stinging
into her eyes, as she remembered how alone in the world
and desolate she was, and how she longed for her dear
aunt and her old home. There in her strange little bed
she cried as if her heart would break for a few minutes.
Then into the confusion of her sad thoughts came the
words, &#8220;Even Christ had not where to lay His head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have!&#8221; she said to herself severely, &#8220;I ought
to be glad and thankful. He gave me this house. It was
just as plain as if I had heard Him offer it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she turned over the little damp spot on her pillow
where the tears had fallen, and deliberately settled herself
to sleep, forcibly putting away all thoughts of her strange
experiences for another time and addressing herself to
rest. There might be dangers passing on the street, but
God had promised to care for her, and she knew she could
trust Him. She needed the rest and must take it. So
she slept and night settled down about the little cottage
under the maples.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A hundred miles away in the darkness a man stole
like a shadow through the night, walking noiselessly down
a deserted road to the graveyard, vanished among the
graves into the velvety blackness under the trees. Appeared
a point of light like a darting firefly fitfully now
and then lighting up the spectral marbles for a gleam and
going out again as if it had not been there. A soft sound
of stirring among the growing things on a grave as one
knelt beside it and worked, breathing hard, the light shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
once more steadily for an instant on trailing vines
and glowing berries, then ceasing entirely. Steps to the
back of the graveyard, and strange, muffled sounds dying
away into silence and midnight.</p>

<p>Later, in a city cellar lair a meeting of angry, puzzled,
incredulous men, and one, resolute, calm, fearless, indifferent,
determined, dominating them all. Money going
around, more than they had expected, yet only arousing
suspicion; and then, before they could protest, the leader
going out into the night alone, leaving them to voice their
suspicions, and plot against him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Judge Peterson woke up in the morning after
a night of restless tossing, and an early morning doze,
he called to his wife with a voice much like his old
time vigor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miranda, bring me my pants. I want to try how
it seems to sit up. I&#8217;ve got to get out of here and find
that little girl. There&#8217;s something queer about this business
and I reckon it&#8217;s up to me to study it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The anxious face of Miranda Peterson that had
been creased all night with tormenting fears suddenly
relaxed and a gleam of joy came into her eyes. This
was her old time husband back again. The visitors hadn&#8217;t
done him so much damage after all, perhaps had only
given him an added incentive to get well. With a spring
in her step and a light in her eye she swung the old-fashioned
wardrobe door open and revealed his baggy trousers
hung up by their suspenders just where she had put them
the night he was taken sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, father,&#8221; she said briskly, &#8220;There they
are. You have your breakfast and as soon as the doctor
comes we&#8217;ll ask him if you can put &#8217;em on. There&#8217;s ham
and eggs this morning, do you feel for ham or only eggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both!&#8221; declared the indomitable old man, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a lot to do today and I want strength. Mother, did
you ever think that Mary Massey suspected her son&#8217;s wife
of not being&mdash;well&mdash;exactly loyal to the family?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miranda Peterson paused in the open doorway:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Yes, I did, father. The last time I was up there
before she died she kind of tried to apologize to me for
asking me to close the door while we talked. She said
she knew Nan wasn&#8217;t very fond of Joyce, and she didn&#8217;t
want her to know we were talking about her future, it
might cause jealousy. She said Nan had accused her of
thinking more of Joyce than she did of her own son&#8217;s wife,
as of course she did. How could she help it? But I
could see she was real uneasy about how they would get
on when she was gone, especially when they found out
about the house. She said then she was going to explain
it all to Eugene right away. But you know she took worse
that night and I suppose she never did get the chance. I
think myself it was a great mistake, letting the children
grow up without knowing all about it, but of course Mary
Massey felt she must keep her sister&#8217;s dying request, and
her sister hadn&#8217;t wanted Joyce to know she had money
coming to her till she was twenty-one. She said she was
afraid it would spoil her. Well, she isn&#8217;t spoiled, that&#8217;s
one thing certain, but it always seems to me when you
work real hard to escape one trouble, you&#8217;re like as not
to run head on to another that&#8217;s about as bad. Look what&#8217;s
happened now. I don&#8217;t blame Joyce Radway one little mite
for not standing that Nannette. She&#8217;s got a tongue like
a hissing serpent, and she can wind that light-minded,
weak-chinned, bull-headed husband of hers around her
little finger. How that poor bag of meal ever came to be
Mary Massey&#8217;s son I can&#8217;t figure, even with a husband
like Hiram Massey, for Mary Massey was the salt of the
earth. Talking about salt, do you want your eggs on
toast? And hot milk? Yes, I know. I&#8217;ll have &#8217;em here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
in the jerk of a lamb&#8217;s tail, and then you&#8217;ll be ready to
talk to the doctor when he comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, mother. And say, send Dan down. He&#8217;s
about isn&#8217;t he? Well, I want him to go an errand. Send
him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan appeared, clean shaven, kindly eyed, with a square
jaw like his father&#8217;s and a determined set to his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan, we&#8217;ve got to find that little girl right away.
Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father. So I told Darcy Sherwood last night.
I&#8217;ve a notion we&#8217;ll be on her track soon. Darcy gets
around quite a good bit, and he seemed interested. Always
thought a good bit of Aunt Mary, you know. Any danger
of that poor fish of a Gene lighting out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said the Judge, &#8220;He&#8217;s too
mad. Thinks his dignity has been offended. It&#8217;s about
all he&#8217;s got left of the family pride, his dignity and he&#8217;s
working that for all it&#8217;s worth. He likes to be bowed
down to, has ever since he was born, and he thinks his
mother&#8217;s Christianity was wide enough to cover him and
his fat, lazy family. I don&#8217;t want to do injustice to anybody,
Dan, but I&#8217;ve a notion that chump needs a lesson
or two and I&#8217;m figuring on being able to give it to him in
a few days. I don&#8217;t know why good women like Mary
Massey have to be afflicted with conceited puppies for sons.
I suppose she loved him so she spoiled him. Women
mostly do. Take your mother. Dan, you&#8217;d have been a
ruined man if it hadn&#8217;t been for the lickings I gave you
with the old birch rod down behind the barn when your
mother&#8217;d gone to missionary meeting. You&#8217;ve never
thanked me for that, Dan, but you&#8217;re a better man for it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
you know. Now, Dan, just slip me those pants on the nail
behind you, lad. I&#8217;m going to surprise your mother.
Hurry up. I hear those ham and eggs coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>With the help of Dan, Judge Peterson got into his
nether garments and was sitting on the side of the bed
when his wife arrived with the ham and eggs, and though
a bit weak and trembly he insisted on sitting up in the
rocking chair without pillows while he ate his breakfast.
The old zest for work and fight had lifted him at last from
his weakness back into the world again and he was determined
to get right into line. Of course the doctor
hustled him back to bed again when he arrived, and glad
enough he was to get there, though he wouldn&#8217;t own it,
but in the half-hour after he had finished the ham and
eggs and before the doctor arrived he managed to get quite
a number of little things started that meant business
for all those who were trying to oppress any of his
beloved clients.</p>

<p>When Dan Peterson came home for the noonday meal
he was able to report that several lines of secret organizations
that thread this land of ours like hidden tracery had
been set vibrating with efforts to find Joyce Radway and
restore her if possible at once to her home. Meantime
Eugene Massey had been notified that while he would
be at liberty of course to remain in the home where his
mother had lived for so many years until its rightful owner
could be found and should return, it must be thoroughly
understood that nothing about the place must be hurt
or sold or destroyed in any way.</p>

<p>It was all done very quietly, and nobody in town
was told. Judge Peterson was friends with everybody,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
but he had been able to go about that town for a good
many years without letting his neighbors so much as
dream that he knew aught about them and their affairs,
or anybody else&#8217;s, and he was not going to begin now by
disgracing the family of his old friend Mary Massey.
Eugene and Nannette simply were made to understand that
they must walk carefully, and that they were under surveillance.
Nannette grew to have a hunted, ingratiating
look, and stayed at home more than had been her custom.
She spent much time writing letters to Joyce and addressing
them to &#8220;General Delivery&#8221; in every part of the
country. She even put advertisements in the personal columns
of one or two big city papers in parts of the country
where her fancy thought Joyce might have wandered. She
questioned Dorothea and Junior nightly on what they
knew about Joyce&#8217;s friends, and habits in the village; and
concerning anything that had been said to them during
the day about her. They acquired the habit of being
sharply alert to any scrap of news that might bear in the
remotest degree upon the tragedy in their home. For
even to their childish minds this that had happened in
their family had assumed the proportions of a tragedy.
Their mother cried a good deal and scarcely ever made
desserts for dinner. Their father had locked up cousin
Joyce&#8217;s room and taken the key. They were forbidden
to go into the parlor and play on the piano, and anything
that had been very especially nice in the way of furniture
was guarded carefully. Their father explained to them
that it might mean some one had to go to jail if it turned
out that they had no right to things and any thing had
been injured. Scarcely a night passed that their father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
and their mother did not have a wild orgy of argument
ending in a fit of weeping on their mother&#8217;s part. Dorothea
and Junior decided that it would have been better to have
Joyce back. Besides, they were hungry for jelly roll. They
even set out on one or two expeditions of their own to
find their cousin, but only got into some trouble each time,
and once Junior barely escaped with his life from under
the wheels of an automobile.</p>

<p>But the worst of all to their thinking was when their
father decided that they must all go to church every Sunday.
Dorothea didn&#8217;t mind so much because she could
wear her prettiest clothes, but Junior hated the white stiff
collar his mother made him wear, and the sitting so long
without wriggling, for Eugene was very strict, and the
time seemed endless.</p>

<p>Quite respectably they filed into the church the first
Sunday after Joyce disappeared, just as if they had been
doing so regularly during the three years they had lived
in Meadow Brook. Of course every one thought they
were doing the proper thing after a death in the family,
and would probably never come again. But the minister
welcomed them gravely, and Nannette in her new black
veil which was almost becoming, dabbed her eyes with a
black-bordered handkerchief when he spoke of the departed
mother who had been so faithful in her church attendance
during the many years. People spoke to them sympathetically,
it was not in their scheme of Christian living to do
otherwise; but one or two sharp voiced sisters who believed
in &#8220;speaking their minds,&#8221; asked pointedly after Joyce
and wanted to know when she would be back. Nannette
had by this time concocted a flexible story about her having
gone to see several distant relatives of her father&#8217;s in response<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
to a telegram. Whereupon one keen minded sister
who had a daughter in the telegraph office hastened home
to acquire further details. Before night Nannette&#8217;s version
of Joyce&#8217;s western visit had grown and acquired
definite shape, with a definite destination and even the
length of time she was to stay. It reached the minister&#8217;s
wife who told it to the minister on the way home from
church, and they decided to write to the minister in the
town where Joyce was visiting and ask him to call on her
and make her feel at home, and incidentally discover if
she looked happy and all was well with her. So the ball
rolled on, and Eugene, despite his ravings and rantings,
was powerless to stop it.</p>

<p>Lib Knox suddenly began to cultivate Dorothea&#8217;s companionship
industriously, using her own peculiar methods
for so doing. She brought Dorothea a handful of tulips
which she had stealthily extracted from one of the finest
gardens in town, and she offered her five minutes&#8217; lick from
her all-day sucker. Now, although Lib was somewhat of a
social outcast, much sneered at by the children who were
not in her clique, Dorothea was nevertheless flattered by
the unusual attention given her by this notorious outlaw,
and was presently deep in the ecstasy of an illicit friendship
with a child whom respectable mothers tabooed. Not that
Lib at the age of eight had reached any depths of wickedness
beyond most, but she had no respect for age and class,
she did as she pleased without regard to clothes and manners,
and she could sling a fine line of truth uttered in
purest Saxon language at any one who dared attempt to
interfere in any of her plans. &#8220;Not a nice little girl&#8221; was
what the mothers met in social conclave said about her,
and she early knew it and delighted to distress them by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
cultivating their young hopefuls and leading them into
bypaths of mischief where only her guiding hand could
lead them safely out again. Lib cultivated Dorothea until
Dorothea was as wax in her hands, and no foreign spy
or diplomat could have used advantage with keener skill
than did little Lib Knox of the dancing bronze curls
and the wicked green eyes. What she did not extract
of facts from unsuspecting Dorothea&#8217;s soul was not worth
extracting.</p>

<p>The high school professor felt keenly annoyed. He
trusted his intuitions violently, and to have the opportunity
to prove them taken away from him by so simple a thing
as a girl going on a visit was not to be thought of. In
the first place it was not like a girl with a face like that
one to suddenly fly up without any reason and go off on
a series of visits to distant relatives, right in the midst
of important examinations which he had all reason to
suppose she had worked hard for and was anxious to take.
In fact, the members of the school board whom he consulted
all agreed in his judgment of Joyce&#8217;s character and
the things they said about her showed that she had every
reason to wish to pass her examinations well and get a
position to teach. There must be something behind all
this and he meant to ferret it out.</p>

<p>So he put aside his stacks of examination papers and
took his hat and went for the third time to interview poor
Nannette. But Nannette saw him coming and fled to the
attic, locking herself in, and keeping quiet as a mouse
till he grew discouraged knocking and went back to his
papers once more. But he did not give up. He searched
out Eugene&#8217;s city address and got him on the telephone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
grilling him for fifteen expensive minutes as to the cause
of Joyce&#8217;s leaving, and why he couldn&#8217;t reach her by telephone
or wire if he tried every place that she had expected
to visit. Eugene was reduced almost to a state of distraction
and came home that night in a worse temper
than ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night four men sought out an old haunt where
they had been accustomed to meet and sat in dark conclave.
They were big, husky fellows and three were dark-browed
with heavy jaws and hands that could break an
iron bar or crush a lily, but one had bright red hair and
unclean eyes, with a voice that had continually to be hushed
by his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I</i> say there&#8217;s a <i>skirt</i> somewhere in all this,&#8221;
he bellowed forth as he raised a glass of ill-smelling liquor
to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You spilled a mouthful!&#8221; hissed out one they called
Bill. &#8220;He never cleared out alone. D&#8217;you know who the
dame is, Tyke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got my ideas,&#8221; boasted the red-haired one
mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whaddaya know, Tyke? Spit it out. This ain&#8217;t
no Deef Mute Club. You&#8217;ll get in the same class with him
if you go around keepin&#8217; things ter yerself, an&#8217; you know
what that means, Tyke! We ain&#8217;t to be trifled with. Can&#8217;t
swing that game with us the second time. It&#8217;s mates or
hang, and you understand. Now, let her fly. Whaddaya
know?&#8221; A heavy hand came down on his shoulder
and Tyke shivered in his long length like a serpent
taken unawares.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;Take yer hand off&#8217;n my shoulder you, Taney, ur ya
don&#8217;t get a word outen me.&#8221; He shook the rough grip
off and shuffled into another position. &#8220;You fellers go off
like powder. Ef you don&#8217;t quit yer suspicions I&#8217;m outta
this fer good, and then where&#8217;ll ya be? I got brains, an&#8217;
I know a thing er two, an&#8217; when I say I got ideas I ain&#8217;t
sayin&#8217; I know it all, but I got a line on it. I think I can
foller it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;?&#8221; The heavy hand came down once more
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;&mdash;well&mdash;boys, I seen a girl in the graveyard
that night. Splashed my flashlight full in her face oncet.
I think he seen her too&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A low mutter from Bill as he took another drink
in big gulps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know who she was?&#8221; asked Cottar, the man who
had not spoken yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope. I don&#8217;t live around these diggin&#8217;s you know,
but I&#8217;d know her again ef I seen her, I swear I would.
She had eyes you don&#8217;t forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man drank in silence and watched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get it all off&#8217;n yer chest Tyke&mdash;&#8221; said Bill at last.
&#8220;There&#8217;s more comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyke edged in his chair uneasily. He dropped his
voice to a whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;She slep&#8217; in a hammock that night. I seen her. I
follered after he went back to the village. I made an
excuse an&#8217; cut across to the station. Remember? But I
come back after you all left an&#8217; went down the road a piece.
I think I could find the house again. I seen her in a hammock
underneath the trees.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>The men bit hard on their pipes and watched him in
silence piercing him through with little narrowed eyes in
the smoke haze of the room, grilling his soul to see if
it were true.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whaddaya figger?&#8221; Taney asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t figgerin&#8217; yet. Gotta find out more. Gotta
find that girl. Gotta find him. Ef they&#8217;re both gone,
they&#8217;re gone together. You all didn&#8217;t think fer a little
minute that guy told a straight story, did you? You all
didn&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d give up a business that was rollin&#8217; in
the money hand over fist jest fer what he called conscience,
did ya? Just because he thought it wasn&#8217;t a nice, pretty
little business? Not on your bottom dollar he didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe he got cold feet,&#8221; suggested Cottar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold feet? That guy get cold feet? Nope, you
don&#8217;t know him. Nothin&#8217; couldn&#8217;t ever make him get
cold feet. I know that guy. I seen him in France. He&#8217;d
walked right outta the dugout just after his bunk had been
shot away an&#8217; smoke a cigarette as cool as if he was takin&#8217;
a ride in a pleasure park. Nothin&#8217; didn&#8217;t never faze him.
He&#8217;d just eat up danger. He thrived on it. No, sir, the
only thing he&#8217;d ever fall fer was a skirt, an&#8217; it&#8217;s a skirt
that&#8217;s done it this time fer sure ur I don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;.
No siree, he&#8217;s got that last cache all salted down somewheres,
good and rich you bet, an&#8217; he&#8217;s throwed us off&#8217;n
the track an&#8217; thinks we can&#8217;t find out where he got it from
ner where he&#8217;s sold it to, but we&#8217;ll show him we&#8217;re too
smart fer him. I ain&#8217;t got red hair fer nothin&#8217;. I wouldn&#8217;t
ha thought he&#8217;d a lied to me, we was like brothers, we was;
in France, I took him back to the base when he got his,
an&#8217; he brang me a drink when I had the fever an&#8217; was left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
on the field with the little love messages comin&#8217; over constant
from the enemy all around me, he just walked out
calm as you please, just like he always is, an&#8217; said, &#8216;Tough
luck, kid, but we&#8217;ll pull you outta here&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut that!&#8221; said Bill sharply, &#8220;We ain&#8217;t hearin&#8217; any
soft soap. We come here to get fair play an&#8217; justice. He&#8217;s
a sharper he is! He&#8217;s a slick robber! He promised us a
big deal when we went into this here dangerous business,
an&#8217; he&#8217;s went back on his word. He let us take all the
risks, an&#8217; he hung round in the bushes. An&#8217; then here
he comes along after he gets the business goin&#8217; fine to
suit him an&#8217; pays us a couppla hundreds apiece an&#8217; says
he&#8217;s <i>done</i>. That he&#8217;s decided to <i>leave off</i>. Now&mdash;Tyke,
you there, you just might ez well understand what I&#8217;m
sayin&#8217;, we ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; no soldier boy blarney about this
guy at all. He&#8217;s turned <i>yaller</i>, an&#8217; took <i>all the dough</i>!
Bought us off with a trifle, an&#8217; skipped the country! Left
us here to face the music while he skips out with a dame
an&#8217; spends his thousands. No, sir, I ain&#8217;t no fool. Drink
o&#8217; water ain&#8217;t in it. Get him a knockout. That&#8217;s what he
needs, an&#8217; we&#8217;re here to do it, d&#8217;ya hear, Tyke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shure, I&#8217;m with ya boys, I was only tellin&#8217; ya,
he ain&#8217;t no bloomin&#8217; coward, an&#8217; don&#8217;t ya reckon on that.
He&#8217;ll take his medicine with a smile if we ever catch him
to feed it to him, an&#8217; don&#8217;t you ferget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a goin&#8217; to knock that there bloomin&#8217; smile
off his pretty face,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;Get me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here too!&#8221; declared Tyke lustily. &#8220;But we gotta
find the skirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We gotta make one more try fer the boodle,&#8221; declared
Bill, &#8220;an&#8217; that we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to do t&#8217;night. I been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
figgerin&#8217; we ain&#8217;t looked carefully down at that first place
we went, out near the point ya know. There&#8217;s a spot down
behind some hazels&mdash;&#8221; he lowered his voice and looked
around the room at the hazy groups around the tables
and finished his sentence in a whisper.</p>

<p>A door opened across the room, a face shone with a
white pallor through the blue haze of smoke, and a low,
sibilant voice uttered a single sentence:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cop&#8217;s comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>A soft shuffle of feet on the sawdust floor, and the
gray figures in the room melted like mist from a breath,
as if the rushing in of the outside air had blown them
all into rings of smoke and carried them away. Mysterious
doors opened and closed as if they had not been, and
the room was quiet and deserted, the proprietor and his
assistant reading the sporting pages with their feet on a
table when the cop swung along and looked in:</p>

<p>&#8220;Business pretty poor t&#8217;night, Jake,&#8221; he said with a
significant look around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, Cap&#8217;n, pretty poor. Beats all how a man&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to live ef this here prohibition keeps up. Have a glass o&#8217;
sody, Cap&#8217;n? Sorry I ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; better to offer ya.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the night gray figures melted into black shadows,
and a low voice murmured: &#8220;Behind the hazel&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And out at sea a revenue cutter paced the coast, and a
little black boat with a silent crew and no lights, dropped
down after a long wait behind the horizon and stole away,
hovered back to watch, and stole away again just before
the dawning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> did not get up as early as she had planned. She
had been utterly worn out with the experiences of the last
two days and human flesh will have its revenge. The
sun stole into her little casement windows, and laid warm
fingers on her brown hair, but she did not feel them. She
was sleeping deeply. It was the grocery boy with the
little yellow Ford from the store across the way that finally
reached her consciousness. He was possessed of a clear,
sharp whistle, and a jazzy tenor voice and when he was
not using one he was using the other while he unloaded
boxes from the freight station.</p>

<p>Joyce roused at last, rubbed her eyes and looked
around, for a moment forgetting where she was. The little
house was full of sweet air and brilliant sunshine, and
in the maples overhead two robins were singing with all
their might. The world sounded cheerful and busy and
she felt rested and more ready for life than when she had
crept between her newspapers the night before.</p>

<p>As her eyes wandered over her own painted walls
suddenly she saw the two five dollar bills pinned there,
waving a little in the morning breeze. Where could they
have come from? Had some one, a former occupant,
pinned them there for safe-keeping while at work? And
must she waste her valuable time going out to hunt for
the owner? Then she spied the ragged edge of one bill,
and a crooked tear half way across, and noticed that the
other was crisp and new. These must be the bills she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
paid the men for their work! That tear was unmistakable.
She had been afraid it would tear all the way across before
she got rid of it. The other two bills she had used had
been crisp and new. She remembered that the man who
drove the truck got a crisp, new one. It was the two
older men who had left this money for her. The kindly
spirit of the rough workmen drew sudden tears to her
eyes. To think that such a beautiful act should be done
by rough workingmen who were utter strangers to her.
Gentlemen at heart they were. Ah, more than that, God&#8217;s
men. Surely her Heavenly Father, knowing her need,
had let them be his ministers. She knelt suddenly beside
the wooden box and prayed a blessing on the men, and
a thanksgiving to the Father who had thus given His help,
and arose feeling strengthened. Somehow the nearness
of God her Father, Christ her Companion had become
real to her in a new sense. Some might have said this
little bit of money came from the kindness of humanity,
and proved nothing about an overruling God. Joyce knew
better. She had the inner witness in her soul that God was
with her, the spiritual sense that comes to those, and those
only, who believe, and who yield their lives to leading because
of that belief, which becomes Faith, the Faith of our
fathers. Because Faith is the gift of God in answer to
our deliberate act of belief. Joyce had no question but
that her Father&#8217;s hand was in every happening of her
life and had one suggested that all these things would have
happened anyway, whether she believed, or prayed or not,
she would have merely smiled as at one who is talking
about something he does not understand. So simply had
she been taught in the Faith while she was yet a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
child, and so deeply and truly had the Faith grown within
her year by year.</p>

<p>Joyce smoothed her hair with the tiny comb and mirror
in her handbag, and decided to hunt up the railroad station
and wash her face. She did not care to appear at
Mrs. Bryant&#8217;s until her arrangements were more complete,
neither did she wish her to know that she was so hard
put to it for shelter that she had slept in a newspaper bed
all night. It would not look well for her reputation to
be poor as a tramp. She wanted to be respected if she
was poor, and she wanted to hold up her head and feel
independent, not to have people feel they must offer her
charity. She must hunt up those two men right away
and try to make them take that money back, or thank
them at least if she found it would hurt their feelings to
restore the money. She felt deeply touched at the thought
of their act of kindliness. Perhaps they had daughters
of their own, and had noticed her thin little purse. Men
who would take the trouble to dig up a vine and make a
shelf to keep it safely must have fine souls within them.</p>

<p>Joyce folded her bed into an innocent-looking pile of
papers, so that it would tell no tales of the night, in case
any one looked in the window, pulled the casements shut,
and moving the box against the wall softly opened her
door. As she did so she noticed for the first time a key
hanging on a nail high up on the door frame. She fitted
it into the lock and found to her joy that it worked perfectly.
The coast seemed to be clear for the moment.
The yellow Ford, without a muffler, had whizzed away
after another load of freight, and the only person on the
side street was walking away with his back toward her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
She cast a furtive glance toward Mrs. Bryant&#8217;s kitchen
door but it seemed to be closed and no one about, so she
locked her door, slipped quickly out the gate and around
the corner without being seen.</p>

<p>She found on inquiry that the pretty little stone railroad
station was only four blocks away. It contained a
tiny wash room that was in tolerably clean condition, so
that she was able to make herself quite respectable, although
her serge dress did look a bit rumpled from sleeping
in it, and she realized that a hot iron for pressing must
be among the first necessities, if she was to keep neat
and presentable for finding a job. An iron would mean
some kind of a stove. What kind? There was no gas
in her little house, and she hated oil. Aunt Mary had
felt it was dangerous. Still, that was probably the only
thing possible. Mrs. Bryant would perhaps let her press
her dress once, but she did not want to be constantly beholden
to her landlady for the every-day necessities. Well,
a way would come. She must trust and work each problem
out as it appeared. She could not face them all at once.</p>

<p>She stepped into a drug store and got a glass of good
milk and three butter thin crackers at the soda counter,
and then went out to hunt up the two men who had
left the money.</p>

<p>But they were not where they had been the day before,
and a careful search for several blocks finally discovered
only the truck man who said the other two were on another
job that day and would probably not return to that suburb
at all as the work was about done there. When she told
him that she wanted to thank them for their kindness,
she could see by the way he said he would tell them that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
he knew nothing about their kindly act, and she had to
turn away and be satisfied with only this. Looking up
to the waving leaves of the trees in the sunshine, and to
the blue, blue sky overhead a great thankfulness came
into her heart for all that had come to her, and she lifted
a little prayer, &#8220;You tell them, Father. Make them know
I thank them.&#8221; She wondered whimsically as she walked
down the pleasant street, whether she would meet them
some day in heaven, and make them understand then how
truly she had appreciated what two strangers had done
for a lonely girl.</p>

<p>She went back to the little line of stores that was already
beginning to make this new suburb look like a
commercial centre, and found a small utility shop where
she bought thread, needles, a thimble, a paper of pins,
enough cheese cloth for window curtains, some blue
and white chintz that the woman let her have for fifteen
cents a yard because it was all that was left, half a yard
of white organdie, and a big blue and white checked
apron of coarse gingham that would cover her dress from
neck to hem and was only fifty cents.</p>

<p>There was a hardware store next door, and here she
found a partial solution to her fire problem in canned
alcohol and a little outfit for cooking with it. She also
invested in some paper plates and cups, a sharp knife, a
pair of good scissors, a hammer, a can opener, some tacks,
and a few long nails.</p>

<p>She stopped at the grocery store on her way back and
bought a can of vegetable soup, a box of crackers and
some bananas, and hurried back to her domicile, excited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
as a child with a new toy. She had spent just six dollars
and twenty-three cents.</p>

<p>But first she must pay her ground rent, so after depositing
her bundles she ran to Mrs. Bryant&#8217;s door
and knocked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryant welcomed her with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real glad to see you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t pay
you yet for yesterday. Mr. Bryant said I ought to have
asked you if you had a place to stay all night. He said
we owed you a great deal and he left this ten dollar bill
for you. He said it was worth a good many times that
what you did, carrying that broiler out of the house. You
see it&#8217;s all wood ceiling up behind that range, and if it had
caught fire the house would like as not have gone. You
know I had some dish towels hanging up on that little line
to dry, and two of them were scorched. I found that out
this morning. It wouldn&#8217;t have been but a minute more till
the whole would have been in a flame, and then the wall
would have caught. And Mr. Bryant hadn&#8217;t renewed the
insurance. The time was up day before yesterday, and
he had been busy and had just let it slip by without
realizing till this stirred him up. So he appreciates what
you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was quite all right, Mrs. Bryant. I didn&#8217;t
want to be paid for what I did yesterday. It was I who
distracted your attention and made you forget your meat,
and I wanted to make up for it. I couldn&#8217;t think of taking
so much anyway. I just helped you out when you were
in a hurry. Anybody would have done that. And I&#8217;m
sure you helped me out. I came in to pay my first month&#8217;s
rent,&#8221; and she laid a five dollar bill down on the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll take that,&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant, &#8220;but you&#8217;ve
got to keep the ten. My husband put his foot down. Five
is for getting the supper, and five is for saving the house.
It really isn&#8217;t much you know when you stop to consider
it. Why we&#8217;d have lost everything. Now, is there anything
I can do to help you? When do you move in?
Want to borrow anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, perhaps I may need something by and by,
but I&#8217;m all right so far,&#8221; said Joyce ignoring the question
about moving in. &#8220;I&#8217;m wondering if I can get some
water now and then at that outside faucet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sure, get all the water you want. It&#8217;s right
handy for you, and there&#8217;s a drain out by the back door
you can use too, or you can throw your dish water into
the garden. Here, I&#8217;ll show you&mdash;&#8221; and she whisked
outside and made Joyce acquainted with all the ins and
outs of the kitchen shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind a bit if you come and wash out your
clothes in these tubs,&#8221; she added thoughtfully. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
do much washing out there in that little tucked-up place.
Besides, you&#8217;d have to carry so much water. Better just
bring anything you want to wash in here and rub it out.
There&#8217;s the wire clothes line outside, and you can fix it
to wash on the days when I don&#8217;t so we won&#8217;t interfere.
How&#8217;d you ever come to buy that little shack anyway?
Some agent sell it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; said Joyce smiling frankly, &#8220;I just saw
it as I passed by and it appealed to me. A man was knocking
it to pieces. I got there just as he struck the first blow
and it shivered like a person, such a pretty little house!
I needed a house myself and I asked if I could buy it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
They said it had to be taken away at once and finally they
agreed to sell it if I took it away in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant eyeing her thoughtfully,
&#8220;You were hunting a house were you. Where&#8217;d you come
from? How&#8217;d you happen to come to our town?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I just walked till I came to it I guess. You see my
aunt died with whom I have lived since my parent&#8217;s death,
and I felt as if I could go on living better if I tried a
new place, it wouldn&#8217;t seem so sad, so when I reached
this region I just took a trolley and rode till things looked
interesting and then I got off and walked till I came on
the little house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryant looked interested. Joyce&#8217;s story was
vague but it intrigued her. Her life had never contained
such romance as walking off into the world till you found
a place you liked and then camping down there. Joyce
was a new kind of girl and she liked her. But she also
wanted to satisfy her own curiosity and her sense of the
conventions, so she proceeded with her inquisition. Also,
it was necessary to have an explanation ready to give at
the Ladies&#8217; Aid that afternoon of the new little house that
had come to park on her premises. She knew every one
would ask about it. She could hear them now, &#8220;Whoooo&mdash;is
she? Wheeer&mdash;did&mdash;she&mdash;come&mdash;from? Whoooo&mdash;knows&mdash;her?
Whiiiiiy&mdash;is&mdash;she&mdash;here? Whoo? Tu&mdash;Whit,
Tu&mdash;Whoooo?&#8221; for all the world like so many owls.
Mrs. Bryant meant to be ready to silence all voices. Her
husband was sponsoring this girl by allowing her on his
premises, and she was not going to have anything questionable
said about her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;What you going to do now you&#8217;re here?&#8221; she asked
abruptly. &#8220;Have you got means of your own, or do
you have to work?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce flushed but answered without hesitation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve enough to get along on I think until I
get a job. Of course I could have found something easier
at home I suppose, but I thought it would be better to
make a change. I guess I&#8217;ll find something pretty soon.
I&#8217;ve got to get settled first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant, &#8220;What&#8217;s your line? You
a stenographer or what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! I guess,&#8221; laughed Joyce. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been aiming
to get ready to be a teacher, but I suddenly decided to
come away just before the examinations so I guess I&#8217;ll
have to wait for that. And anyhow it&#8217;s almost vacation
time. I&#8217;d have to do something else until fall of
course. I wonder if perhaps I could arrange to take
examinations here? I don&#8217;t suppose you know when the
state examinations come off in your public schools here,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I could find out this afternoon. I&#8217;m going
to Ladies&#8217; Aid an&#8217; Mrs. Powers is always there. Her
husband&#8217;s on the Board of Trustees, and she mostly knows
everything about education. I&#8217;ll ask her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Joyce gladly, &#8220;I should be so glad
if there was some chance for me to get my try-out before
next year, for I really want to teach. I&#8217;m hoping for a
position. I can get along with almost anything else in
the way of a job until then. I&#8217;d like to take my examinations
while everything is fresh in my mind. I&#8217;ve been
studying hard all the spring for them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll see if that can&#8217;t be arranged somehow.
There ought to be somebody round that has got some pull
with the school board. Meantime, if you find a job and
want references, just send &#8217;em to me. I&#8217;ll be glad to tell
anybody you&#8217;re all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t know me, Mrs. Bryant. How could
you give me a recommendation?&#8221; laughed Joyce in
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you all I need to know,&#8221; said the good woman
decidedly. &#8220;You&#8217;re a good girl and a capable girl. Nine
out of every ten girls I know would have screamed and
run for the fire company instead of stalking in here and
doing something. And I can&#8217;t be sure of one that would
have come in here and helped me the way you did with
that dinner when I was hard put to it, not even for pay.
They&#8217;d have had too much to do in their own affairs. And
if they had come after urging they wouldn&#8217;t have known
what to do without being told at every turn. You told
me, and you made things go, and I say you&#8217;re a smart
girl and a good girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such praise from a stranger was sweet to Joyce&#8217;s
lonely soul and she found the tears welling to her eyes,
but she choked them back with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Bryant, I&#8217;ll try to live up to the
recommendation you&#8217;re giving me. I only hope you won&#8217;t
ever have reason to take it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t believe I shall. Now don&#8217;t hesitate to
ask for anything you want to borrow, and let me know
if there&#8217;s anything I can do for you. By the way, if
you want to clean any before you get a stove just come
over and get hot water. I&#8217;m going out this afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
but I&#8217;ll leave the kitchen key under the door mat and if
you want to, just come in and put on the teakettle and
get all the hot water you need.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Joyce went down the short path to her own door
with gratitude in her heart and a ten dollar bill in her
hand, saying over to herself the words that had leaped to
her lips of a sudden out of the stores of the past when
she and Aunt Mary learned whole chapters out of the
Bible and repeated them to one another:</p>

<p>&#8220;And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the
cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it almost funny,&#8221; she said to herself thoughtfully,
&#8220;The money comes back just as fast as I spend it
for the things I need, faster in fact. It&#8217;s wonderful to
be cared for this way!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Back</span> in her house she set to work on her curtains,
cutting the cheese cloth in lengths, and hemming it with
long, even stitches. It did not take long and her fingers
flew rapidly. She was always a fast worker on whatever
she took up, and her thoughts kept pace with her work.
Suppose Mrs. Bryant should find out that it was still possible
for her to take her examinations! Suppose she got
a school here! Could she live in the little house all
winter? How would she get heat? And light? She
would have to work and study in the evenings! How
many problems there were to meet when one dropped
away from a home and provided it for oneself!</p>

<p>There were strings enough around the packages to
run in the hems and hang the curtains, but the windows
had to be washed before the curtains could be put up, so
Joyce ran over to the store for a few more purchases.
A broom, a scrubbing-brush, soap, a galvanized pail and
a sponge. She had no rags but a sponge was wonderful
for paint and windows. Then a bright thought came
to her and she asked if they had any boxes for sale. They
took her down to the cellar where were boxes and barrels
of all sizes and shapes. She selected several boxes and two
nice clean sugar barrels, besides two delightful boxes with
lids swinging on tiny hinges. These would make wonderful
closets for her china when she got some. She had to
pay ten cents apiece for them.</p>

<p>It was noon when she got back, and all the whistles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
were blowing. She lighted her little alcohol can and heated
the can of vegetable soup. This with crackers and a
banana for dessert made a fine meal and while she was
clearing it away the boy from the grocery brought over
her boxes and barrels, and the place began to assume a
look of furniture. Mrs. Bryant came to the door with a
roll of old rags as the boy went away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you might like some cloths for cleaning,&#8221;
she said, stepping in at the door. &#8220;I have such quantities,
so I brought some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you,&#8221; said Joyce, &#8220;I was wondering if I
could make my windows shine with newspapers. Now
I won&#8217;t have to try. Won&#8217;t you come in and sit down.
Here&#8217;s a nice clean box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No thank you,&#8221; declined the lady stepping back with
a glance of approval around the little room and at the
window where Joyce had tacked up a finished curtain to
try it. &#8220;I&#8217;m on the committee for serving the luncheon
at the Ladies&#8217; Aid today and I have to hurry. We serve
at one and it&#8217;s almost that now, but I saw your goods coming
in and I thought you might need these so I just ran
in. I left the teakettle on and you can just turn it
out when you are done. How cosy you are going to
be! This is a real cute little house. Well, I must run along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce drew a long breath as she watched her go.
&#8220;Goods.&#8221; She glanced at the barrels and boxes amusedly.
So she had thought these were her goods. What would
she say if she knew she had no goods in the world? And
she had so hoped to get the little room looking habitable
before there were any visitors. Well, the woman hadn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
noticed the lack of furniture, and perhaps she would be
able to do something about it before she came again.</p>

<p>She changed her serge dress for the new gingham
apron, got the hot water and went happily to work scrubbing
with all her might. In a short time the place was smelling
sweetly of soap-suds and gleaming with the whiteness
of the paint. Evidently there had not been much wear
and tear on the inside of the place since it was painted,
for when the dirt was washed off it came out nice and clean.
There was an advantage too in having a small place. It did
not take long to clean it. The five windows and the door
were soon finished, and then she swept and scrubbed the
floor, and put up her curtains.</p>

<p>She stood back when the last tack was driven with
a sigh of satisfaction and looked around. It certainly
did look cheerful and pretty. She could imagine being
quite happy in this pretty place. Now there must be some
inner curtains to draw when night came on and screen her
from the passers-by. They could be of cretonne and there
would have to be five-cent rods for them, so that she
could draw them back and forth. How many things
there were to buy! Perhaps she could find some cheap
cretonne and get enough for a curtain across one end to
screen her bed from view until she could manage to get
one that was respectable. Beds cost a great deal, even
just cot beds, she knew for she had bought one once for a
poor family at Aunt Mary&#8217;s request. Then there was a
mattress and pillows. So many, many things to buy. But
there would be a way. See, how her money had increased
as fast as she had spent it. Could she trust that such
care would continue until she had an income? And the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
old chant from the beloved Bible story of childhood went
over again in her head: &#8220;And the barrel of meal wasted
not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word
of the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce was not a modernist. She had been taught to
believe the Bible literally, and found no difficulty with
miracles. She was not dumb nor ignorant. She knew
that the academic world was largely inclined to put aside
all that was miraculous, and to doubt everything that
they had not seen happen in every-day life; but she looked
upon such as souls who had not chosen to accept God&#8217;s
way of proof, the proof that comes to the soul of every
true believer who takes God at His word, and cannot
doubt because He knows. Miracles never had bothered
her, because if God could make <i>anything</i> why couldn&#8217;t He
make or do anything else? She had once heard a wonderful
man who came to Meadow Brook to preach say
that mystery was something that God knew but didn&#8217;t
tell right away, and ever after that the mysteries that she
found in the Scriptures had been but more beautiful to
her. They never troubled her nor made her doubt. She
was a bright girl with a more than ordinary mind and a
fair education, but she accepted the things of the kingdom
as a little child and when some one pointed out to her
a spot that seemed a contradiction to facts as she knew
them she would smile and say, then <i>she</i> had made some
mistake, not God, and not His word. That was how
Aunt Mary brought her up. More and more as Aunt
Mary drew nearer to the end of this life and saw how
miserably she had failed to teach her own son heavenly
things did she yearn to give this dear girl something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
substantial to stand upon when all else failed. And if
she had not left Joyce anything else she had left her a
great Faith in the living God and in His Word.</p>

<p>But it was growing late in the afternoon and Joyce
was weary. The night was coming on again and the
question of light had not been settled. Perhaps she had
better run over and get some candles and a few more
things for supper. She was hungry as a bear, and the
can of soup seemed a forgotten dream.</p>

<p>So she went to the store again, and when she came
back and had eaten some sandwiches of dried beef and
bread and butter and drunk some milk she felt better, and
set to work to arrange her box furniture to advantage.</p>

<p>There were the two barrels. They were to make
easy chairs, one for herself and one for any possible company
that might come in. They would have to wait to
materialize until she could buy material to upholster and
cover them, and until she had time to work over them.
They would need sawing. Oh, they must wait, but when
they were finished they would stand here, and here&mdash;she
wheeled them into place. And right here between them
should stand a table&mdash;she placed the biggest square box
there, and imagined a lamp with a pretty shade, and some
magazines lying on it.</p>

<p>The two boxes with hinged lids she nailed to the wall
in the corner she called her diningroom and kitchen.
These were her china closets. She carefully placed her
paper cups and plates in one and arranged the cracker
box, the milk bottle and other supplies in the other. Somehow
she must manage shelves for them. There were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
some loose bits of boards in one box. These would make
shelves if she could manage to borrow an old saw.</p>

<p>In the corner beyond the window next her bed she
placed another box for a dressing table. Some day she
would drape it in chintz and get a looking glass to hang
over it. Chintz or cretonne was really one of the next
things she needed. There must be a curtain to shut off
her bedroom. She did not want everybody to know she
was sleeping on a paper bed, and a curtain would give a
little privacy. Besides, she must curtain off a small corner
for a closet.</p>

<p>She was suddenly interrupted in her meditations by a
tap at her door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered if you were here yet,&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant
as she opened the door, &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t come in, I&#8217;ve got
to run back and start supper. But I just stepped over to
tell you Mrs. Powers, the lady that lives in the big brick
colonial with tulips in the yard, perhaps you&#8217;ve noticed
it&mdash;she was at the Ladies&#8217; Aid today and was going on
something terrible about how she was going to have company
from Baltimore tomorrow, and her maid had gone
away sick yesterday and isn&#8217;t coming back for a week.
She had telephoned in town for a maid but they couldn&#8217;t
get her any she would have and she didn&#8217;t know what
to do. She said her friend hadn&#8217;t seen her in a long time
and she wanted to take her around in the car and she
just didn&#8217;t see how she was to cook dinner too. Well,
she seemed so distressed and all that I finally up and told
her how you helped me out last night. I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s
you&#8217;ll like it, but she seemed so interested that I went on
and told her all about you, how you were a teacher, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
you&#8217;d bought this little house and were going to teach
school in the fall, and then she looked awfully disappointed
and said: &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s a teacher, is she? Then
I don&#8217;t suppose she&#8217;d be willing to help me out, would
she?&#8217; And I said, well, no, I didn&#8217;t suppose you intended
doing things like that, that you were a perfect lady, but
you might do it once for accommodation. I finally said
I&#8217;d tell you anyhow. She said if you would come she&#8217;d
gladly pay you five dollars for cooking dinner, and if you
were willing to wait on the table too why she&#8217;d pay ten. I
really hated to tell you about it after I&#8217;d promised, but
you can do as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d be glad to help her,&#8221; said Joyce pleasantly,
&#8220;and I&#8217;d like to wait on the table too. I really want to
earn the money of course, and while I don&#8217;t think I want
to be a cook for life, still I don&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s going to
hurt me to cook a few dinners for other people. I&#8217;ve
had to do it in my own home a good many times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d feel about it. I think
it&#8217;s fine of you. Some folks are so kind of proud nowadays.
But I somehow thought you were sensible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what should I be proud about?&#8221; laughed Joyce.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any reputation here to lose anyway, and if
people want to think less of me because I know how to
cook they can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I say you&#8217;re a real fine girl. So that&#8217;s settled,
and I&#8217;m kind of glad, for her husband&#8217;s on the school
board, and if she wants to she can do a lot for you. You
run right in the house and call her up. Her number is
95 and her name is Powers. I told her you&#8217;d call.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Joyce ran in to the telephone and came out smiling
in a moment:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much, Mrs. Bryant. This will
help me out a lot. I&#8217;ve just been thinking of a good
many things I want to get and I wasn&#8217;t sure I ought to
spare the money. Now I can get them right away. I&#8217;m
to go to her at twelve o&#8217;clock and stay till after the dishes
are washed. Which way did you say she lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>After most explicit directions had been given Joyce
went back to her house and flew at the bundle of chintz
with swift fingers. There was about three hours of daylight
left&mdash;the evenings were long this time of year&mdash;and
she must use every minute of them for she must have
a thin dress to work in and she did not want to burn a
light and show that she was staying nights in the place
until she had things looking a little more comfortable,
both because she did not want any one to offer her charity,
and because she did not care to have them all know how
poverty-stricken she really was.</p>

<p>She folded her material crosswise in the middle and
spread it upon the driest place on her cleanly scrubbed
floor. Then she laid her blue serge smoothly down upon
it with the shoulders to the fold and the kimona sleeves
stretched toward the selvages. The material reached
below the serge far enough for a good hem, and guided
by her serge dress she took her sharp, new scissors and
carefully cut out a straight little simple slip of a dress.</p>

<p>She had cut many a dress before, on Aunt Mary&#8217;s
big diningroom table with a box of shining pins and a
tried and true pattern to guide her. But she knew the
lines of a simple dress well enough and she could not see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
how she could go far astray in her cutting. It had to be
long enough and wide enough for it was as big as her
blue serge. So she clipped away, and soon had a dress
cut out, making the neck line only a curved slit until she
should try it on.</p>

<p>Then she sat down and ran up the two side seams
on the right side and slipped it on to try it. Of course
she had no mirror but she managed to get a vague glimpse
of herself in the closed lattice of her window. It needed
a little taking in under the arm, but the rest seemed all
right, and she slipped it off again and sat down to make
the changes and French the seams. Another trial and
the fit was found to be better. She hunted out her pins
and turned up the hem. This she found rather a hard
proposition, but after several takings off and readjustings
it seemed to swing evenly.</p>

<p>She was growing tired, and her back began to ache
with sitting on the hard box after her day of scrubbing
and curtain making. She wondered if she could keep at
it much longer?</p>

<p>With a weary impulse she flung her paper bed out
in the corner and threw herself down upon it.</p>

<p>For almost ten minutes she forced herself to lie and
relax, trying to think of nothing and really rest. Then the
clock on some distant building struck eight, and she roused
up, suddenly aware that she had but a few more minutes
of daylight and that if she lay here she would soon be
asleep. She simply did not dare leave all that sewing
till morning. She must have a neat, washable dress ready
by twelve o&#8217;clock in which to work. So she stood up
and tried to cut out the neck of her frock as best she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
could, wishing all the time for a big mirror. She finally
got out the two-inch bit of glass belonging to her handbag
and inspected her work, deciding it would have to do.
Then she caught up a newspaper and cut and experimented
until she had a pattern for a simple collar to fit the neck
of her dress. This she cut from the half-yard of organdie,
also cutting organdie cuffs to fit the short sleeves.</p>

<p>It was quite dusky now in her little room and she had
to take the pieces of chintz that came off the sides of
the dress out on her front step to see what she was doing.
Here she cut from the longest piece a string belt, and
several long strips of bias binding about an inch wide.
Then rolling up these with the organdie collar and cuffs,
her scissors, thimble, needle and thread, she put on
her serge dress and hat and hurried down the street.
She had thought of a way to work a little longer that
night without burning a light. She would just sit in the
station waiting room a little while and sew.</p>

<p>The soft evening breeze of the out-of-doors revived
her weary body and she felt quite cheered and happy.
To think, she was going to earn a whole ten dollars in
one afternoon and evening! Here was her Father providing
her with more money again just when she had
discovered so many things she had to buy, that it overwhelmed
her. The &#8220;barrel of meal and the cruse of oil&#8221;
again! How wonderful it was!</p>

<p>When she reached the station, however, her plans
seemed balked for the station itself was closed and dark.
There was a bench, however, down along the platform
under a shed-like roof, and a great arc light glowed above
it. People were walking back and forth too as if waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
for a train, so Joyce sat down at one end of the bench and
took out her bit of sewing. No one noticed her and her
swift fingers had soon run on the bias bands around collar
and cuffs, and turned down the binding smoothly. She
just loved the hemming of them down. It was like a
bit of fancy work, and they looked so pretty&mdash;the blue
edging the sheer white. Of course the dress could have
been bound around neck and sleeves without the white
collar and cuffs but this touch of prettiness made it look
more comely, and she must remember her appearance
if she was to hope to get a school around here sometime.
Mrs. Bryant had given her the reputation of a lady and
she must keep it up, even if it meant a little more work
for her.</p>

<p>By the time the half past nine train had gone she had
the organdie bound, and was sewing up the string girdle.
She lingered only until the seams were run up before she
gathered up her things and hurried back to her little dark
house. It was growing lonely on the station platform,
and she did not like to stay any longer, but she could turn
the girdle inside out in the dark by the help of a safety
pin, and then everything would be ready for morning.
She would only have to hem the skirt and put on the
collar and cuffs.</p>

<p>Sitting in the dark on her box she found a safety pin
in her handbag and, fastening it in the end of the girdle,
began pushing it through, and when it was turned all
the way, creased it carefully and smoothed it between
her fingers till it almost looked as if it were ironed flat.
Then she took off her serge dress, put on her gingham
apron and lay down under her paper blankets for another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
night&#8217;s sleep, too weary to do more than thank her
Heavenly Father for keeping her so far. As she drifted
away into sleep she heard a soft, sweet voice, like a pleasant
melody in her soul, Aunt Mary&#8217;s voice long ago, saying
over the golden text from Sunday School, over and over
again till she learned it, &#8220;And the barrel of meal wasted
not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word
of the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have a Bible,&#8221; she said to herself dreamily.
&#8220;I wish I had brought mine along.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> her weariness Joyce did not sleep
well that night. She heard the late travellers passing by
and the milkman and grocery trucks on their way to a
new day, and she tossed on her rattling, lumpy bed till
almost dawn. Somehow all the happenings of the last few
days seemed to have arrived in concrete form and to be
standing about her couch for her to reckon with.</p>

<p>First, there was the matter of her leaving home.
Ought she to have left at all? And if she should have
left, was that the right way to have done it? The whole
problem of her life took on a distorted form in the midnight
and darkness that it had never presented before.
She thought of her friends back in Meadow Brook who
had loved her and Aunt Mary. What would they think
of her going? Perhaps she should have waited to tell
them all, and yet how could she make explanations? It
would only bring discredit upon Eugene and Nannette and
that she did not want to do. No, she could not have asked
her friends, or even have told them good-bye without more
explanation than she was ready to give. There was the
minister, and Judge Peterson, the Browns and Ridgeways,
and a host of others. They never would have let her go
alone out into the world without even a destination, and
no chance of a job. They would have worked it somehow
for her to stay with one of them. She would never have
been free, and Eugene and Nannette would have been
furious at her making a display of their family quarrels
in the town. No, she could have come away in no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
manner. And she had to come. She could not have
stayed much longer even if she had not started that night.</p>

<p>These questions somewhat conquered, her thoughts
turned to the first night away from home, the awful experience
in the cemetery, and the look on the face of
her old friend when she had asked him what he was doing.</p>

<p>And now she knew what had been the underlying
thorn in her soul that had made the pain ever since.</p>

<p>Long ago, perhaps ten years before, when she had
been a little girl, there had been a holiday when she and
Aunt Mary had started off with a neatly packed luncheon
and a handful of books to spend the day in the woods,
a long promised, eagerly anticipated excursion. There
were chicken sandwiches neatly wrapped in wax paper.
How well she remembered helping to make them! And
little blackberry turnovers rich with gummy sweetness.
Hard-boiled eggs, tiny sweet pickles from the summer&#8217;s
vintage, sponge cakes, big purple grapes, and a bottle of
milk to drink. Plenty of everything. Aunt Mary never
stinted a lunch and she always put in enough for a guest
if one should turn up.</p>

<p>And that day the guest really came.</p>

<p>It was a warm, sunny day in October and the leaves
were just beginning to turn. As they climbed the hill
above Meadow Brook and came within sight of the valley,
great splashes of crimson flung out like banners across the
valley and yellow glinted across the purples and browns
like patches of gold in the sunshine. There was a smell
of burning leaves and sunshine in the air and the earth
was sweet with autumn. Blue and yellow and white asters
bordered the road that wound along the hill and dipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
again into the valley among the trees. Purple grackles
were stalking the fields in battalions, their stiff, black silk
armor glinting in the sun, cawing of the weather and their
coming need of flight. She could hear their hoarse, throaty
voices as she lay and stared at the ceiling in her little
lonely house under the maples.</p>

<p>And the air! How sweet and winey it had been!</p>

<p>She and Aunt Mary had climbed a fence and crossed
a field till they reached the deep, sweet woods with its
solemn cathedral silences and its lofty vaulted ceiling.
How far away the world had seemed as they entered and
trod the pine-strewn aisles and penetrated deep into the
cloistered vistas. She remembered thinking that this
must be where God stayed a good deal, it was so sweet
and perfect. Above in the branches strange birds sent
out wild, sweet notes, like snatches of celestial anthems.
Favored birds to live in such safe and holy fastnesses.
She remembered wondering if they ever flew down to
Meadow Brook and fellowed with the common birds, picking
up worms in garden paths, and draggling their feathers
in the dust of the world like sparrows, or did they always
stay here alone with God and praise?</p>

<p>They had found a mossy log to sit upon and a carpet
of pine needles fragrant and deep, and there they had
established themselves, the little girl lying full length
upon the sweet bed of needles, the older woman sitting
upon the log and reading. It was a story book they were
reading, one of Louisa Alcott&#8217;s, was it &#8220;Under the Lilacs&#8221;
or &#8220;Little Women&#8221;? &#8220;Under the Lilacs&#8221; of course, because
it was where the little white circus dog Sancho
appeared that she remembered first noticing the boy&#8217;s back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>There had been crickets droning somewhere, and a
tinkling brook that murmured not far off, and no other
sound save now and then a falling stick or bit of branch
from some high tree top hurtling down, until, with the
advent of that dog there had been a tiny human stir, an
almost imperceptible sound of giving attention, and her
eyes had been fastened on the gray-brown back, the tousled
bright head topped by the torn old baseball cap just a few
steps away in the dim shadowed aisle down which she was
looking. At first she scarcely recognized it as not a part
of the woods, so still it sat, that square, young back in
its faded flannel shirt, held in a listening attitude. Then
gradually she had become aware of the boy&#8217;s presence,
of the fishing rod in his hand, of the bank that he must
be sitting on which had seemed but a level stretch to her
first vision. She had turned a quick glance to Aunt Mary,
but Aunt Mary only looked up an instant, paused to
recognize that there was some one there, smiled knowingly
and went on with the story.</p>

<p>It must have been an hour they sat thus listening to
the reading, the boy and the fishing rod not moving, the
little girl watching with fascinated, dreamy eyes as if
she were looking at a picture that might come alive any
minute, and then suddenly something happened. The rod
bent quickly down with a jerk, the boy&#8217;s arm went out
with a quick, involuntary motion, and a fish swept up from
below somewhere in a great circle and landed floundering
on the grassy bank.</p>

<p>Joyce sat up quickly with round eyes watching the
boy&#8217;s man&#339;uvres with the fish, and Aunt Mary stopped
reading and looked on with interest too. The boy looked
up at last shame-faced and flushed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;Aw, gee!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to interrupt you.
That fish just got on my hook an&#8217; I pulled it before I
thought. That&#8217;s a cracker-jack story you&#8217;re reading.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m glad to be interrupted by such an interesting
happening,&#8221; Aunt Mary answered him. &#8220;What a
beautiful fish! What kind is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a trout. You don&#8217;t find many of &#8217;em any
more. They been all fished out. Want it? I c&#8217;n find
some more when I want &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, I couldn&#8217;t take your fish,&#8221; said Aunt
Mary with a smile, &#8220;But I&#8217;ve enjoyed seeing you catch
it. You better take it home to your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s head bowed a little lower and he said in a
low, gruff voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t got any mother. She&#8217;s dead. They don&#8217;t
want to bother with fish at home. D&#8217;you like me to cook
it for you? They&#8217;re awful good cooked outdoors like
this right on the coals.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to gather sticks and twigs together, and
placed them in a little pile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that certainly would be wonderful,&#8221; said Aunt
Mary smiling, &#8220;Then you can take lunch with us. We
always bring along enough for a guest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked up wistfully and grinned, and then
was off for more sticks.</p>

<p>In a little clearing he built a fire while the little girl
watched him, and put his fish to cook, and then they spread
out the lunch on a big white cloth on a rock the boy showed
them, and they had a great laugh over the bugs and ants
that kept coming to dinner with them.</p>

<p>The boy ate lunch with them, carving his fish proudly
with a big jackknife and serving the biggest portions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
his guests, saying he didn&#8217;t care for fish anyhow, he could
get it whenever he wanted it. But he ate the sandwiches
and little pies and cakes hungrily, and watched the little
girl with shy, furtive glances.</p>

<p>Afterwards he washed the dishes for them in the brook
and packed them back in the basket, then curled down at
Aunt Mary&#8217;s feet while she went on reading.</p>

<p>Oh, the memory of that long, beautiful afternoon
among the pines, with the sun sifting down through the
leaves and the taller trees waving way up almost touching
the sky it seemed, and the drone of bees somewhere, the
distant whetting of a scythe&mdash;how it all came back as she
thought it over!</p>

<p>And then the book was finished and they sat back,
sorry it was done, dreamy with the loveliness of the story
in which they had been absorbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a cracker-jack tale,&#8221; declared the boy. &#8220;Gee,
I&#8217;d like to have that dog. My dog died,&#8221; he ended sadly.
&#8220;Got run over by a truck.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked a little about the dog and the boy got out
a dirty little snap shot of himself with the dog in his
arms when it was only a little puppy, and the little girl
smiled and said it was a darling.</p>

<p>Then somehow Aunt Mary led them around to talk of
other things, of how still it was in the woods, and how
beautiful, and how God must love it there. The boy&#8217;s
face grew sober and wistful and wonder came in his eyes
with a kind of softness. Aunt Mary got out her little
Testament and read the story of the healing of the man
who was born blind, in the ninth chapter of John. How
they thrilled to the story all the way through, as the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
actors came and went, the blind man himself, his
wondering neighbors, the scornful Jews, the cowardly
parents, Jesus, who came to find him after they had all left
him, even down to the words that Jesus spoke to the fault-finding
Jews: &#8220;If ye were blind, ye should have no sin:
but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.&#8221;
How strange that those words should sound even after
these years, with the murmuring of the pines among the
words, and the holy stillness afterward, while the shadows
grew long and violet within the sanctuary of trees where
they sat, and dusk was all about them. The boy&#8217;s lashes
drooped thoughtfully and his whole face took on a far-away
look. Then Aunt Mary&#8217;s voice came again softly
praying: &#8220;Dear Jesus, we know You are here today just as
then. Help us for Christ&#8217;s sake to have our eyes open to
sin, so that we shall always know when we are not pleasing
Thee. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had gone out together silently through the quiet
aisles with only the tall singing of the pines and the distant
melody of thrushes in their evening song above them. The
boy had gathered up the basket and his fishing rod, and
helped them over the fence with a kind of reverence
upon him.</p>

<p>They had walked down the road to the village with
that beautiful intimacy still upon them, like friends who
had seen a vision together and would never forget. All
the way to their door the boy had gone, saying very little,
but with an uplifted look upon his face. Aunt Mary
had asked him to come and see them sometime, and he
had suddenly grown shy and silent, dropped his eyes and
set his young shoulders as if he had come to a hard spot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
&#8220;Well, g&#8217;bye!&#8221; he said gruffly, and turning, darted out
the gate and down the street, flashing them a wonderful
smile as he went. He had become suddenly all boy again.</p>

<p>He had come again several times with gifts&mdash;a splendid
plant of squawberry vine with bright red berries hanging
to it, a great sheaf of crimson leaves and sumac
berries, a handkerchief full of ripe chestnuts.</p>

<p>When winter came again they sometimes found their
paths shovelled around the house very early in the morning
and caught a glimpse of a red sweater and gray cap going
down the street as they arose.</p>

<p>There had been several times at school when Joyce
felt his protection against the larger boys who snowballed
most unmercifully.</p>

<p>Once he drew her on her sled through a drifted place.
And once she found a rose upon her desk and looking up
saw his eyes upon her suddenly averted and knew he had
put it there. But he never came again into their intimate
family circle as he had done that wonderful day in the
woods. His family moved to another part of the town, and
she seldom saw him, yet they always spoke when they met,
and something would flash from eye to eye that was different
from an ordinary acquaintance. They could not
forget that day and that holy cathedral of the woods where
they had companioned so richly together.</p>

<p>She had not seen him often through the years, but
he had come to Aunt Mary&#8217;s funeral, and at the cemetery
stood close to the open grave looking down with bared
head as if he loved the one who was being laid to rest. A
handsome fellow with a distinguished look about him, and
that wonderful wistfulness in his eyes that had not lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the child look and could still flash a smile that lit the hearts
of those who saw it.</p>

<p>That! And then to see him there in the dark&mdash;at a
gruesome task of some sort, and to have seen his eyes as
she asked him what he had been doing!</p>

<p>She had not spoken to him in years. Their sole communication
had been through smiles till she asked him
that question wrung from her lips at cost of pain. Somehow
her words seemed to strike a blow at the dear past
and shatter something that had been most precious.</p>

<p>And now she had gone over it again in the watches
of the night the pain was still there. He had somehow
gone wrong. She had to admit that to her loyal heart.
Perhaps he had been wrong all the time, a bad, wild boy.
She had sometimes heard hints of that floating about
the village but had not believed it. She had clung to that
day when they had read <i>Under the Lilacs</i> together, and
then heard the story of the blind man and gone out together
again into life with the blessing of Jesus resting
upon them. She could not bear to think that the boy who
had been so gentle and kind, so interested and happy in
that sweet, simple place, could have been bad all the time,
and only dropped out of his regular life for the day just
out of curiosity. He must be right and true somehow.
And if he had been doing wrong he must be sorry perhaps,
for he had looked ashamed. She could not get
away from that. She covered her face with her hands
to pray and found there were tears upon her cheeks, and
then she prayed with all her heart, &#8220;Oh, Jesus, go and
find him and make him understand. Open his eyes that
he may see and sin no more.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>About that time a man under cover of the darkness
came down the road from the Meadow Brook Cemetery
and stole into Julia Hartshorn&#8217;s gate, and silently over the
grass to the hammock under the trees; pausing a moment
to look furtively up at the dark house, he stooped and felt
all over that hammock. He had passed the house that
day, slowly, in his automobile and he was sure he had
seen the form of an object sagging in the middle. He
had observed it most minutely. He was come now to
find out. It might give him no clue even if he found it,
but he was here.</p>

<p>His hand moved carefully and came in contact with a
book, yes&mdash;and something soft like cloth, a handkerchief
with a faint smell of lavender drifting from it. He slipped
them in his pocket and went silently away into the night
on rubber shod feet that made no sound, and after he
was gone for a season, came another shadow, stealing as
silently into the yard and up to the hammock. It is doubtful
if Julia Hartshorn and her niece would have ever recovered
from the fright if they had known what went on
in their yard that night. But they were slumbering deeply
and did not even see the tiny spot of light that flashed
over the hammock, and down upon the ground, bringing
out in clear relief a scrap of paper with writing across it.
A hand reached for it, and again the flashlight focused
for a scrutiny. &#8220;oyce Radw&#8221; the paper read and that
was all. It was torn on all its edges, and evidently a part
of a larger writing. The man searched again, but could
find nothing more. So he stole away as he had come, but
he kept the paper safely for future reference.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Joyce awoke the next morning it was with a
feeling of trepidation lest she had overslept and would
not be able to accomplish all that she must before
twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>She hurried around anxiously, folding her newspaper
bed into an innocent-looking pile, putting away her
things carefully for any possible scrutiny, and eating
a hasty breakfast of crackers, cheese and what was left
of her bottle of milk.</p>

<p>When everything was neat and trim she took out
her dress and sat down to sew, wondering if perhaps she
ought not to run out and find what time it was before
she started to work. But fortunately the town clock
settled the matter by chiming out nine o&#8217;clock. Three
hours before she must be at Mrs. Powers! Well, there
was only the collar and cuffs to sew on, the skirt to hem
and the pockets to make. She could get along without
pockets if necessary, but she really needed them. If only
the collar would fit and not have to be made over again
or cut down or anything.</p>

<p>She put in the hem swiftly. That was plain sailing,
as it was carefully pinned. Then she put on the cuffs
and tacked them in place, and donned the gown. Yes, the
collar fitted nicely. With a relieved mind she took it off
again and faced on the collar. While she was doing so
the clock struck ten. If she hurried there would be time
to make the pockets. It was half past before she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
finished the collar and tacked on the girdle. Somehow
her fingers seemed terribly slow. She cut two strips from
the organdie, bound them with blue and sewed them at
the top of two patch pockets. It was striking eleven as
she pinned the pockets in place and began to sew them
on with strong, firm little stitches, but ten minutes would
see it finished. She drew a long breath and began to think
of what was before her. Mrs. Powers had sounded pleasant
but condescending. Well, one could keep still and
obey orders, and after all, condescension didn&#8217;t hurt anything
but one&#8217;s pride. What was pride? She could stand
almost anything for just once.</p>

<p>She must stop at the store on her way and get a clean
gingham apron. She ought to have a white one for
table waiting also. If there was anything cheap enough
she would get it. If there was only another two hours
she could easily make one. But there wasn&#8217;t. She broke
off her thread for the finish, and laid aside her thimble
and scissors happily. Well, the dress was done anyway.</p>

<p>She wasted little time in putting on the new garment
and smoothing her hair, feeling quite neat and trim as
she locked her door and hurried down the street. Mrs.
Bryant eyed her approvingly from her kitchen window.</p>

<p>&#8220;She certainly is a pretty little thing,&#8221; she said to
herself. &#8220;I wish I had a daughter like that. It&#8217;s going
to be a real comfort having her right near this winter
when Jim is away. I&#8217;m glad we let her have the lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce bought her other gingham apron, and found a
tiny white one, coarse, but neat, for fifty cents, and with
her two aprons presented herself at Mrs. Powers&#8217; door at
exactly twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Mrs. Powers herself opened the door, her hair in
crimpers, herself attired in a somewhat soiled pink
silk kimona:</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot to mention that you might come to the
side door,&#8221; she said loftily, &#8220;but it doesn&#8217;t matter this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce paused on the threshold and surveyed her silently.
She had never met anything quite like this, nor dreamed
that people who served others had to endure it. She was
minded to flee at once, till she remembered that she had
promised to get the dinner and that it was probably too
late for the woman to get any one else now. She must
be a lady, even if her employer was not.</p>

<p>Before she could speak, however, Mrs. Powers entered
upon her introduction to the work.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t object to washing dishes I hope. The
lunch and breakfast dishes will have to be cleared away
before you can do much. Here&#8217;s the menu for tonight,
I&#8217;ve written it out so there won&#8217;t be any mistake. I never
like to have to give directions twice. Fruit cup. You&#8217;ll
find the things in the store room, oranges, grape fruit,
some white grapes skinned and seeded, I like plenty of
grapes in it, and there&#8217;s a can of pineapple. Then we&#8217;ll have
a clear soup. Do you know how to make soup? I&#8217;m
sure I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ll make it out of. You can
look around and see. Perhaps there&#8217;s some stock. Then
for the meat course we&#8217;ll have chops and creamed potatoes
and peas. There&#8217;s lettuce in the garden, and tomatoes
in the refrigerator. You make mayonnaise, do you? Mrs.
Bryant spoke of that I think. Well, that fixes the salad
all right. Then ice cream and cake and coffee. I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
ordered the ice cream, of course, but I&#8217;ll need two kinds
of cake. I always like to have two kinds. That&#8217;s all, I
believe. Now, I&#8217;m going up to lie down. I really must
or I&#8217;ll look like a rag, but I shall expect you to have the
diningroom and kitchen cleaned, the peas shelled, and the
mayonnaise on the ice by the time I come down. Then
I shall feel easy. You&#8217;ll need to scald and skin the tomatoes
too, and get at your cake as soon as possible. It&#8217;ll
need to get cold before icing. Now, do you think you
understand it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce looked at her with frank amusement as she
rolled out the sentences, tolling off the tasks as if they
were trifles and expecting, actually expecting all that work
to be done. In spite of her a fresh young laugh rang out
as if it were all a joke. The lady eyed her curiously, uneasily.
What kind of a young working person was this
anyway that laughed at her tasks and came to the front
door for admission?</p>

<p>&#8220;I want dinner promptly at seven,&#8221; she said haughtily.
&#8220;Do you feel sure you will remember all I have told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best to accomplish as much as possible,
Mrs. Powers,&#8221; said Joyce, remembering the ten dollars and
sobering down. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any too much time, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce undid her bundle and enveloped herself in her
clean gingham apron as she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ll show me where to find your
materials.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed the lady comfortably, leading the way
to the kitchen. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll let me know right away if
there&#8217;s anything else you need, because I hate to be disturbed
when I&#8217;m taking a nap.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>She trailed away from the scene before Joyce realized
the whole situation, or it is doubtful if she might not have
fled even yet.</p>

<p>The kitchen was stacked with soiled dishes in every
available spot, and soiled dish towels, grocery bags huddled
together between piles of plates and pans and potato
peelings. It was evident that not only the breakfast and
lunch dishes were unwashed but also the dinner dishes
of the night before, and possibly some from lunch of the
day before. It was a wreck of a kitchen and no mistake.
Joyce stood still in her pretty new blue dress in the midst
of it all, appalled at what was expected of her. It seemed
to her that no two girls could accomplish all that had been
given her to do before seven o&#8217;clock. The cooking alone
was enough to keep her on the jump, without all the cleaning.
She was minded to get at the preparations for dinner
first and leave the clearing up to take care of itself when
the lady came down again, only that absolutely nothing
could be done until there was a clean place in which
to work.</p>

<p>Joyce had been in hard places before, with a meal
ahead to get for company in a short time, and had rather
enjoyed the sharpening of her wits to win the game and
get it done in time. But never had she had such a kitchen
as this to deal with. At first glance her soul revolted from
having to touch it. The floor was grimy and messy with
things spilled on it. Numerous dishes standing under
the sink out of the way with fragments of food burned
hard to them showed discouraging impossibilities ahead.
The sink was filthy with grease and the dish-pan filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
with greasy water. It was all simply unspeakable. She
scarcely knew where to begin.</p>

<p>Investigation showed there was no hot water, and
that the source of it was in a tank heated by a small
laundry stove in the cellar, which was out. Joyce descended
the cellar stairs, found an axe, and split up a box, and
finally got the laundry fire going. Then she came upstairs,
and put three pans and the teakettle full of water
to heat on the gas range. While they were heating she
went to the refrigerator to see what was on hand for
that soup which she was supposed to make.</p>

<p>The refrigerator proved worse than anything she had
yet seen in the house, and greatly needed a good cleaning,
but there was no time for refrigerators. She was weary
in every bone and sinew now thinking of all that must
be done before six o&#8217;clock. But she gathered out whatever
was worth using, some chicken bones, a small piece
of boiled beef, a left-over lamb chop, a bowl of chicken
gravy, a few lima beans, and a cup of mashed potatoes.
Not a very promising array. She cleared a spot on the
kitchen table, skimmed the grease from the gravy, cut
the fat from the meat, and put the whole array on to
simmer with a little water. A little foraging brought some
onions and carrots to light, which she diced and put in
with the mixture. By this time the water was hot and
she scalded the tomatoes and skinned them, putting them
on the ice to harden. Then, with her soup and salad well
under way, she felt more at her ease to go at the cleaning.</p>

<p>The first job was the sink, and it took fully ten minutes
to reduce it and the dish pans to order. Then, as she
could not find any clean dish towels, she washed out those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
that were soiled and hung them out in the back yard.
They would be dry by the time she needed them, for there
was a good breeze blowing. She glanced at the clock as
she came in. Forty minutes of the precious seven hours
was gone and scarcely an impression made on the dreadful-looking
place. She looked around in despair. The second
relay of hot water was ready, and she went to work gathering
first all the soiled silver and putting it to soak in a
pan full of suds while she scraped up the dishes and sorted
them in orderly files. Everything would have to soak
before it was washed, for food had been smeared over
them all and left to dry. By the time the sorting was
done the silver washed easily, and she put them into the
rinsing pan, and filled the first pan with a pile of plates
to soak while she washed off the drain board and shelf
and made room to drain her dishes. Inch by inch she
cleared places and filled them with clean, steaming dishes,
filling her pans again and again with hot water. The
laundry stove was getting in its work by this time and
the water from the faucet facilitated matters, nevertheless,
it was half past two before she had every dish subdued
and standing in clean, dry rows on a clean, dry table ready
to be marshaled into pantry shelves that sadly needed cleaning,
but could not have it now. She must get that fruit
dug out and on the ice at once.</p>

<p>She turned her attention to cake next, and when it
was in the oven went at the mayonnaise dressing. She
had made a chocolate layer cake, rich and dark, with a
transparent chocolate filling and thick, white icing, and
was just taking a sponge cake, light as a feather, out of
the oven when the mistress arrived, fine and cool in a light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
cr&ecirc;pe de chine, her hair marcelled and her face powdered
to the last degree, leaving a perfume of luxury in her
wake as she moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Is that all the cake you&#8217;ve
made? And look at the time. You&#8217;ll have to frost that,
of course. It&#8217;s too plain that way. Have you fixed the
salad? And, oh, I forgot to say&mdash;There&#8217;ll have to be hot
biscuits. I hope you can make good ones. Mr. Powers is
very particular about his biscuits. He likes them light. I
must say you might have scrubbed this floor a little bit, and
by the way, I wish you&#8217;d run up by and by while your vegetables
are cooking and wipe up the bath room tiles. My
son took a bath this morning just before he went off on a
trip and he left water all over the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce turned suddenly from setting the hot cake carefully
on a cake-cooler and faced the lady. Her cheeks
were two pink flames and her eyes were bits of blue ice.
For just one second words trembled on her lips, words
that were not humble nor gentle. Here was a woman
much like Nannette, who appeared, to think the world was
made all for herself. Joyce longed to lay down the knife
with which she had loosened the cake from its pan and
walk out of the kitchen as she had walked out of her
cousin&#8217;s kitchen a few days before, never to return, but
she reflected that she could not go on walking out of situations
all her life that she did not like, and moreover
it would be a mean thing to leave the lady with her dinner
only half got and company coming. It was obvious the
lady was unfitted to get it. And then, she had promised
to do it. The lady had depended upon her and she must
stick. Why not make a game of it, something that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to be overcome and won? So she let her lips soften into
a smile and answered with a twinkle of amusement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll have time, Mrs. Powers, but
I&#8217;ll do my best. Things were pretty badly messed up
here, you know, and it all took time. By the way, Mrs.
Powers, Mrs. Bryant told me that your husband was on
the School Board. I wonder if you could tell me whether
there is likely to be any opening for a teacher next fall?
You know I am a teacher. That is, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been
getting ready to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something, just a shade of fineness perhaps,
in the way Joyce spoke, a kind of sense of being above
littleness and an air of being there to help her purely as a
favor, that made the lady the least bit ashamed of having
asked her to wipe up the bath room floor. She stared at
Joyce a minute in that superior sort of surprised way, as
if suddenly some ribbon or powder puff or bit of lace
she had been using had risen up and claimed a personality,
and then she answered in a cold little tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. There might be. If
you put this dinner over well and get it all done on time
I&#8217;ll try and remember to speak to him about it. Mr.
Powers loves good dinners, and he might do something
for you. I&#8217;m going down in my car now to meet my
friend and I wish you&#8217;d answer the telephone while I&#8217;m
gone and keep an eye on the front door. And don&#8217;t for
mercy&#8217;s sake let anything burn. I just hate to have the
house smell of burned food when guests arrive. Don&#8217;t
forget the bath room floor, and have plenty of biscuits.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady sailed away again after having peered into
the refrigerator at the tomatoes and fruit cup getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
chilled, and sniffed at the kettle of soup on the back of
the range, with never a word of commendation. Something
strangely like tears came into the girl&#8217;s eyes as she
turned back to the kitchen and reviewed the work still
to be done, looking despairingly at the clock. Quarter to
five! Could she do it? One thing she was sure of, she
would never work for this woman again if she could
help it. There seemed to be no pleasing her. It had been
quite another thing to get dinner for Mrs. Bryant, who
was delighted with everything she did. This woman
treated her as if she were the very dust under her feet.
Perhaps she had made a mistake in consenting to do kitchen
work. Perhaps she had lowered herself in the woman&#8217;s
eyes and hurt her chance of getting a school. Well, she
must forget it now. It was all in the game and she was
out to win. It was just another hindrance put in her way,
a net to get her ball over, a wicket through which she must
pass. She would win out in spite of it. So, trying
to coax a laugh into her throat instead of a sob, she went
to work with redoubled vigor.</p>

<p>When the cake was frosted and standing white and
beautiful in the window to dry she slipped up to the bath room,
wiped up the floor and tidied it a bit. It needed a
vigorous cleaning but she had no time to give it. Then
she hurried down to shell the peas and scrape the potatoes.
When they were on she would feel easier in her mind.
There was a stalk of celery in the store room and a few
English walnuts. The salad would look prettier if she
diced the celery and stuffed the tomatoes with celery
and nuts. She must try to get time. It wouldn&#8217;t take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
a minute. Then the lettuce must be got from the garden.
It ought to be in salt water this instant.</p>

<p>The next hour was a wild whirl. It seemed, as she
rushed from table to range and from refrigerator back to
the kitchen, that she had been rushing, rushing, ever since
she left home, and she was tired, oh, so tired.</p>

<p>The biscuits were in the oven and the potatoes and
peas bubbling gaily on the stove, the chops were in
the broiler and Joyce was trying to set the table, when
Mrs. Powers returned with her guest. After taking her
to the guest room upstairs she came languidly down to see
how the dinner was getting on. She said no word of commendation,
but a look of satisfaction dawned in her eyes
as she saw the orderly row of salad plates, daintily and
appetizingly arrayed on the kitchen side table, and caught
a glimpse of the two cakes in the pantry window smooth
and glistening in deep frosting. Joyce caught the look
or perhaps she would not have been able to go on through
the next trying hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Powers, I can&#8217;t find but one of those rose
napkins you said you wanted to use. Could you tell me
where else to look?&#8221; she asked as the lady returned to
the diningroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m sure they are in the drawer,&#8221; said the
lady sharply as if somehow Joyce must have lost them
herself. &#8220;They&#8217;re always right there.&#8221; She came and
looked herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess they didn&#8217;t get sent to the laundry,&#8221;
she admitted at last reluctantly after a hasty slamming
of sideboard drawers. &#8220;Oh, here they are. How tiresome!
Well, you&#8217;ll just have to take them down to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
laundry and rub them out. There&#8217;s no other way. The
others simply aren&#8217;t fit. Here, take these. You&#8217;ll find
the electric iron right down there and you can iron
them dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce paused aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the dinner,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Things will burn, and
I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t be on time if I wait to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have to manage somehow. I&#8217;m sure I
don&#8217;t know what else you can do. We&#8217;ll have to have
dinner late then I suppose, although Mr. Powers hates
that. He always says never hire a person twice who can&#8217;t
get meals on time. It&#8217;s the worst fault&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Joyce had seized the napkins and was already on
her way down to the laundry, her lips set in a hard, determined
little line. The School Board should never be able
to say she couldn&#8217;t be on time, even if it was the School
Board&#8217;s wife&#8217;s fault that she couldn&#8217;t be. She would win
out and have dinner on time anyway.</p>

<p>So with a quick turn of the faucets, and a fling of
the soap, she rubbed out the necessary napkins, and while
they were soaking for a minute, hunted out the electric
iron and set it heating. Up the stairs again to her dinner
to watch the chops and turn the lights under the vegetables
a little lower, breathlessly down again, such a wild scramble!
Quarter to seven it was when she came up again with
the three neatly ironed napkins in her hand and wildly
flew into the diningroom to finish setting the table. The
sweet potatoes were browning in their sugar bath and
she had to watch them closely that they did not burn. It
meant flying back and forth continually&mdash;and oh, there
were the olives, the ice water, and cream for the coffee.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
Would the dinner ever be ready and served? And where
was her apron?</p>

<p>The last five minutes were a nightmare. She could
hear the front door open and the voice of the two gentlemen
as they entered. Which one would be Mr. Powers?
The gruff, deep one, or the high falsetto? And then came
the awful minute when she donned the new white apron,
and came to sign to Mrs. Powers that all was ready. The
clock in the living room was chiming seven with silvery
tones as she signalled her readiness, and she thought she
saw a look of surprise and relief in the languid eye of
the hostess, but she stayed not to make further discoveries.
She would have her hands full for the next few
minutes without knowing whether the lady was pleased
or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely He shall deliver thee&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>What was it that Bible verse said that ran through her
head with every pulsation of her racing blood? Why
should a Bible verse come so persistently into her mind
just now when she was too busy to think about anything?
&#8220;Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the
fowler, and from the noisome pestilence&#8221;&mdash;that was it.
The snare of the fowler was the little things that caught
one. Well, He had delivered her. He had helped her
to smile instead of to be annoyed. Was she winning out?
Dinner was on time anyway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> guests were eating away at the fruit cup with
a relish. It was delicious, Joyce knew, for she had tasted
it when it was finished. She was hot and thirsty and
she longed for some of it now, but there was none left.
She had filled the glasses as full as possible. She heard
one of the guests say how delicious it was, and the
hostess reply in her languid drawl that it wasn&#8217;t what
it ought to be, that she had a new maid, and she was
sure she didn&#8217;t know whether they were to have anything
fit to eat or not. She was brand-new, and green, and what
was worse, she was <i>literary</i>. &#8220;Fancy, Clement,&#8221; and the
lady turned to the tall man with the deep, growling voice
and her laugh rang out, &#8220;fancy, she wants me to recommend
her to you as a teacher in the High School! Isn&#8217;t
that the limit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce was just coming in to take the glasses and replace
them with the bouillon cups filled with a delicious
concoction that came out of that mixture of bones and
meats and vegetables with the addition of a bit of tomato,
onion, celery top and parsley, and she stopped short in
the pantry with flaming cheeks and quick tears in her eyes,
and then stepped hastily back into the kitchen and paused
in dismay. What should she do? How could she face
that tableful of hateful people with their laughter still
upon their lips?</p>

<p>There before her stood the kitchen door wide open
to a garden and a path that led around the house to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
gate. She could walk out and leave this impossible woman
to her fate. Let her get up and serve her own guests,
and wash her own dishes afterwards and keep her own
ten dollar bill, yes, and her school positions too. There
were other people in the world&mdash;and the tears rolled down
her hot, angry cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely He shall deliver thee,&mdash;Surely&mdash;Surely&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It rang in her ears like a voice, a reminder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know&mdash;&#8221; said her tired heart. She mustn&#8217;t
get into the habit of walking out back doors when she
didn&#8217;t like things. She really mustn&#8217;t. &#8220;Dear Jesus,
please give me strength, courage&mdash;&#8221; She dashed the tears
away and splashed cold water on her hot cheeks, then
in answer to the third ringing of the buzzer appeared in
the diningroom as if nothing had happened and quietly
removed the glasses from the table.</p>

<p>In her pretty little blue dress with her white collar
and apron she looked a slender vision as she entered with
her tray and was conscious at once that every eye was
fixed upon her, whereupon her cheeks flamed the rosier,
but she kept her eyes down upon her work and managed
to get through the door with her heavy tray of glasses
without breaking down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove!&#8221; she heard the gruff voice say. &#8220;She looks
as if she could teach if she wanted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; chimed in the falsetto, &#8220;quite pretty for
a kitchen-maid, I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite too pretty, I should say,&#8221; said the cool voice
of the lady guest, like a sharp, dividing steel, significant,
insulting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Joyce trembled as she heard Mrs. Powers respond in
her affected drawl:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, I thought so myself. But what could I do?
I&#8217;d have had to get dinner myself&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she seems to know how to cook,&#8221; growled
Mr. Powers. By this time his soup was steaming at his
place and he was regarding it with interest.</p>

<p>Joyce caught his glance fixed pleasantly upon her as
she went about placing the soup, and took heart. Perhaps
all hope of a chance through Mr. Powers was not lost
after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely He shall deliver thee. Surely&mdash;&#8221; The
words kept ringing as she went back and forth from
kitchen to diningroom, dreading each encounter more than
the last.</p>

<p>As the meal progressed it became evident that all were
enjoying it and the men at least were loud in their praises
of each new dish as it arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I say. These peas taste as if they had just been
picked,&#8221; said the guest, and his host replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Anne, these sweet potatoes beat anything we
ever had. Get her to stay if you can. Pay her fifty dollars
a week if you want to, only get her to stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Powers turned a languid smile of disgust on
her woman guest and answered scornfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t that just like a man? Candied sweet
potatoes and a pretty face! That&#8217;s all they think about.
I wish you&#8217;d see how she left the kitchen floor! And she
had <i>plenty</i> of time to clean it up before she began to
get dinner.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;Well, if you ask me,&#8221; said her husband heartily,
&#8220;I&#8217;d say cleaning kitchen floors wasn&#8217;t her job.&#8221;</p>

<p>All these things she heard in stage whispers that were
not intended for her ears, as she went back and forth
bringing dishes and serving new courses.</p>

<p>At the salad even the ladies waxed a little kindly, but
when the ice cream came on and with it the two great
luscious cakes there was loud applause from the gentlemen,
and it was evident that if a position in high school
depended upon making good cake Joyce had won it. She
hastily placed the last coffee-cup and retired precipitately
from the diningroom, afraid that after all she was going
to break down and cry. She was so tired!</p>

<p>But cry she wouldn&#8217;t. She had one more thing yet
to do before anybody had a chance to come out in that
kitchen. She would scrub that kitchen floor if it took
the last bit of force she had left in her body.</p>

<p>So she closed the pantry and kitchen doors, donned
her gingham apron again, and got down upon her knees
with hot water, soap, and scrubbing-brush, and a great
drying cloth she had found in the laundry. Such a scrubbing
as that inlaid linoleum had it never had had before
and never would likely have again!</p>

<p>She laid a newspaper down by the sink to keep it
clean when she was done, and then straightened herself
up and rested for a moment, wondering if the ache would
ever go out of her back and knees again. It wasn&#8217;t just
the scrubbing the floor, nor the working hard to get
dinner; it was the culmination of the days since she had
left home.</p>

<p>But she must not take time to think how tired she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
was. There were the dishes yet to wash, and the table
to clear. All those dishes! How long the evening looked
ahead! They were rising from the table at last and she
must hurry with the dishes already there and get them
out of the way.</p>

<p>So she went at the dish-pan again, her fingers flying
as though she had just begun after a good night&#8217;s rest.
And one by one, dozen by dozen, those dishes were marshaled
again into shining freshness, and the table cleared.</p>

<p>She had just decided that she would slip out the back
door and let Mrs. Powers send her the ten dollars when
she got ready, when she heard the pantry door open and
Mrs. Powers stood in it, surveying her coldly, a crisp ten
dollar bill in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going! I was going to ask you to wipe
up this floor before you left&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and glanced down at the shining floor,
from which Joyce had just removed the newspapers. She
seemed a trifle flustered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve done it. Well, that&#8217;s all right. I never
feel that a girl has finished until she has cleaned her
kitchen.&#8221;</p>

<p>She handed out the money and Joyce took it as though
it had been a hot coal that she wasn&#8217;t sure but she wanted
to throw out the back door. Of course she had earned
it, earned it hard, but it went against every grain in her
body to take it. She felt humiliated and dragged in
the dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely He shall deliver thee!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew a long breath. It was almost over. She
was free to go at last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;I was going to tell you,&#8221; went on the lady as Joyce
rolled up her apron preparatory to leaving, &#8220;I&#8217;m giving
a little dinner tomorrow and I shall want you again. You
might come over about ten. We don&#8217;t get up before that,
and then you can clear away the breakfast things. We
have dinner about five on Sundays. My husband says
the day is so long if we don&#8217;t have a good many meals.
I&#8217;m calling up my butcher to get some chickens. Of course
he&#8217;s closed, but he always serves me after time if necessary.
He knows he has to or lose my trade. I think we&#8217;ll
have some more of those biscuits, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce suddenly broke into the monologue:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Powers, excuse me, but it isn&#8217;t necessary for
you to finish. I couldn&#8217;t possibly come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t possibly come? I&#8217;d like to know why
not? I suppose you have some date or other with some
young man&mdash;I might have known a pretty girl would
be troublesome&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Joyce, her voice trembling, and just
then above the wild beating of her angry young heart
she heard the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely He shall deliver thee&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It steadied her so that she was able to control the
flashing of her eyes and to speak quietly, albeit with a
trifle of hauteur in her steady voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Mrs. Powers. You have no right to
speak to me in that way. I have no young men friends
nor any others in this vicinity and no dates with any one,
but I do not work on Sunday. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right.
I was brought up to work only six days in the week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake!&#8221; sneered the woman, &#8220;and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
you refuse to help a person out in a tight place? What
possible wrong could that be? We have to eat, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to have dinner parties,&#8221; said Joyce
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think you&#8217;re impertinent,&#8221; said the lady
angrily. &#8220;It is none of your business when I have dinner
parties. I suppose it&#8217;s more pay you want, and I think
that&#8217;s extortion, but of course seeing you&#8217;ve washed the
kitchen floor and seeing I can&#8217;t very well get any one
else I suppose I&#8217;ll have to pay it. What do you want for
your valuable services?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, Mrs. Powers. I am not going to work.
If you were sick or in trouble or starving I&#8217;d be glad to
help you out, but I shouldn&#8217;t accept pay. I am not working
on Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll pay you fifteen dollars for the day if you&#8217;ll
come. That&#8217;s outrageous but I&#8217;ll pay it because I have to.
And if you&#8217;ll come early enough in the morning to get
breakfast I&#8217;ll make it twenty. Come, that&#8217;s about as
high as any girl could ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible for me to accept at any price for
Sunday service, Mrs. Powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce had retreated toward the door and picked up
her bundle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can possibly expect me to
use my influence to get you a school when you act like
that,&#8221; said the angry woman as a last resort. &#8220;I shall
tell my husband how unaccommodating and impertinent
you have been. You are not a fit person to set over young
people. And if you refuse my request I shall take pains
to see that you get no position in our schools. As for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
all this nonsense about working on Sunday, don&#8217;t you
know, my poor girl, that all that belongs to a bygone day?
The Sabbath was made for man, and not to be long-faced
in. I am in a far better position than you to know what
is right and what is wrong, and I tell you that it is perfectly
all right for you to help a person out when they have
company, and at the same time help yourself out, and I&#8217;ve
offered you very liberal wages. I&#8217;m perfectly willing also
to see that you get a place to teach if you prove to be at
all fitted for it, provided you go out of your way to
help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce looked at the woman steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Powers, I would rather never have a position
to teach than purchase it at the price of doing something
I think is wrong. Besides, I couldn&#8217;t help hearing what
you said about me at the dinner table, and I&#8217;ve no
expectation of your using your influence to help me in any
way. In fact, I think I&#8217;d rather you wouldn&#8217;t. Good
night, Mrs. Powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was actually gone, out the back door, through the
moonlit garden, out the little back gate, and down the
street, before Mrs. Powers recovered and realized that
she had lost her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t come,&#8221; she announced, going back to the
living room, where her guests and her husband were awaiting
her return to the game of cards in which they had
been engaged, &#8220;and she actually had the nerve to try
to preach a sermon to me about having dinner parties on
Sunday. Did you ever? Aren&#8217;t help the limit these days?
I suppose it made her mad for me to ask her to scrub the
bath room floor. She&#8217;s quite inclined to be above her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
station. But isn&#8217;t it ridiculous? Now I&#8217;ll have to get
Martha Allen to cook the dinner and she can&#8217;t begin to
make mayonnaise like this girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you told me she wasn&#8217;t help,&#8221; said her
husband. &#8220;You said she was a school-teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well&mdash;&#8221; said the wife indolently, &#8220;you know
what a school-teacher is that has to go out to work to
make a living. Just as soon as I knew she would come
I set her down where she belonged, and made up my mind
if she was any good I&#8217;d get her permanently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a laudable ambition. Coax a girl to
come and help you as a favor, and then try to keep her
down to the station you&#8217;ve put her in! I must say I admire
a girl who is willing to cook when she hasn&#8217;t anything
else to do, and especially when she knows how to cook
like that. I believe I&#8217;ll look into her case. If she applies
for a job in the school I&#8217;ll vote for her. I like a girl with
ambition and without notions, and I&#8217;ll bet she earned her
money today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Hatfield, that&#8217;s just like you,&#8221; complained
Mrs. Hatfield Powers. &#8220;I take the trouble to tell you what
a good-for-nothing girl she is and then you go and vote
for her just for sheer stubbornness. Just to oppose me.
Just to show you how wrong you are about money, I paid
her <i>ten dollars</i> today for getting that little bit of dinner,
and I went so far as to offer her double that if she would
come early enough to get breakfast and stay all day tomorrow!&#8221;
She looked around the room in triumph amid
the admiring exclamations of her guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I still say she earned her money,&#8221; said her
husband.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Joyce Radway let herself into her little dark room,
locked her door, tossed her hat on the box table, flung herself
on the heap of newspapers in the corner and burst into
heart-breaking sobs.</p>

<p>By and by her tears were spent and she grew quieter,
and above the tumult of her soul a still small voice seemed
saying over the words softly to her troubled heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are
the Everlasting Arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>How wonderful that that should come to her now!</p>

<p>Once, a long time ago, when she was a little girl and
was learning verses with her mother and her aunt, they
had told her that these verses they were teaching her were
to be stored up for a time of need, and that when any
distress came, if they were safely in her heart and memory,
they would come out to comfort her or show her the way
out of a difficult situation. She had not thought much
about it then, but now that all came back. She was in
trouble and comfortless, and the verses were coming like
a troop of strong angels to comfort and guide her and
help her through temptation&mdash;to show her that God was
not a God afar off, but was nigh to each one of us, even
in our hearts. So, comforted, she fell asleep.</p>

<p>And the next day was the Sabbath.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Joyce awoke that first Sunday morning in her
new home the sun was streaming broad across her bed.
By that she knew it was very late. It suddenly came to
her consciousness for the first time that she had been so
busy getting her dress done in time to reach Mrs. Powers&#8217;
at twelve o&#8217;clock that it had never occurred to her to do
any marketing for Sunday, and of course everything had
been closed up tight when she came home at half past
ten. Well, there was enough in the house to keep her
from starving, and she would just have to get along. There
were probably restaurants open, but why go to a restaurant
on Sunday? She had not been brought up to be much
away from home on the Lord&#8217;s day, and while she understood
that it might be necessary sometimes for restaurants
to be open on Sunday for some poor homeless ones,
still, she didn&#8217;t see patronizing them if she could help it.</p>

<p>Examination of her larder proved that there were still
a few crackers, a small piece of cheese, two slices of dried
beef, one banana, and almost half a loaf of bread. There
was a little milk left in the bottle too, and she could have
that for breakfast. It was not an extensive array for
a Sunday dinner, and probably Mrs. Powers&#8217; menu would
have offered a more tempting list, but she drew a relieved
sigh to think that she did not have to get Mrs. Powers&#8217;
dinner that day, no, nor eat it, either.</p>

<p>She ate her breakfast of crackers and milk hungrily,
for one cannot work as hard as she had worked for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
past three days without developing an appetite, and by the
time she was finished, and everything put away, the church
bells were ringing.</p>

<p>It was interesting to be going to a new church. All
her life she had attended the same church. It came to
her while she was brushing her shoes and putting on her
serge dress and hat that, perhaps, some of the dear people
would miss her and wonder. Perhaps sometime she
would write to the minister or her Sunday-school teacher
and explain that she had felt an entire change would be
good for her, less sad; and that she had gone thus quietly
because she dreaded the good-byes. Yes, that would probably
be the right thing to do after she had once established
herself, and had a good paying job, and could report herself
as doing well. It made her almost homesick to think
of how all the old friends were on their way to Sunday
School just now&mdash;how her place would be vacant in the
class and her spot in the pew empty.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time though, for Nannette had
contrived both Sundays since Aunt Mary&#8217;s death to keep
Joyce at home, the first time because she had a sick headache
and wanted Joyce to stay and wait on her, the second
time because she and Eugene were going somewhere and
demanded that Joyce remain at home with the children,
who were supposed to be under the weather. People would
not think it strange that she had not come this Sunday
either, perhaps, and she knew Nannette well enough to
be sure that by this time there was some well-arranged
story sent about explaining, with perfect plausibility, her
absence. So she had no uneasiness on the score of
her friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>She chose the pretty church with the stone arches and
ivy wreathing for her first entrance into religious worship
in her new home. It bore the name of her own denomination
on its bronze tablet outside the door, and she entered
with a kind of feeling that it partly belonged to her.</p>

<p>The church was filled with well-dressed people, and a
vested choir was singing an anthem as she entered. She
was annoyed to be late and slipped into a seat near
the door.</p>

<p>The vested choir would have been an innovation in
the old church in Meadow Brook, but she thought it
rather pretty. The church was artistic and beautiful, with
deep-toned woods, vaulted ceiling, and gleam of jeweled
windows picturing forth sacred themes in memory of
certain departed church members. She sat in the softly
cushioned pew and listened to the glorious music, the rich
tones of the organ, the well-trained voices. Now, indeed,
was her soul to find rest and refreshment for the hard
times of her life. She relaxed and found peace and a
sense of nearness to God in this, His house.</p>

<p>The Powers family entered, to her surprise, a bit
noisily, with their guests, and made quite a flutter getting
certain seats. They seemed to be important personages, for
whom the ushers hurried to find the place in four hymn
books, and present calendars of the day, with smiles and
obsequious bows. The men were fresh from a round on
the golf course, and had that air of bored patronage and
indifference that so many men wear on Sunday morning,
as if virtue fairly exuded from their rosy faces because
they had come in from the velvety green to this sombre
stuffy dullness for a little while to patronize God. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
women were attired in spring array and filled the air about
them with the faint, sweet perfume of the well-groomed.
The eyes of their envious sisters were fixed upon their
hats and coats in earnest study from the minute of their
entrance, and many a woman forsook her mild attention
to the service and tortured her mind with such problems
as how she could get together a becoming hat like that
without paying the price of an imported one, or whether
there was enough in the breadths of grandmother&#8217;s old
silk gown to cut a silk coat like the one Anne Powers
was wearing.</p>

<p>Joyce, in her back seat, was surprised that her
employer of yesterday should be in church. She had
unconsciously labeled her as a non-churchgoer. In
Meadow Brook the people who gave dinner parties on
Sunday did not pay much attention to churchgoing, and
as she watched from her shadowed seat under the gallery
and saw Mrs. Powers&#8217; delicate airs, and the way she held
her book and sang, she marvelled that this pretty woman,
with the rapt expression, could be the same one who spoke
so contemptuously to her the day before.</p>

<p>But when the minister ascended the pulpit for the
sermon she tried to put such thoughts away from her
mind and to listen to what was being said. It was not
for her to judge the people in God&#8217;s house, and God himself
might be able to see something acceptable in the worship
of these people that was not apparent to her.</p>

<p>The minister had read the story of the man born
blind, and it had given her a warm feeling about her
heart to remember the dear old story, so linked with
thoughts of her Aunt Mary, and especially of that wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
day in the woods, so she settled herself to enjoy
the story once more, and to thrill over the miracle of the
healing as she had always been able to thrill over this
particular story even after she had grown up.</p>

<p>As the sermon opened up with an eloquent passage
descriptive of the oriental day and setting of the story
her mind was back in the aisles of the grove with the
boy and Aunt Mary, and the birds singing far overhead.
Her own sweet thoughts leaped ahead in the story, till
suddenly, she became aware of words that were being
spoken, words that did not seem to fit the thread of the
story at all. What was this? No miracle? Common
sense? Jesus used clay to give the man something to
do himself, possibly it might have had some medicinal
qualities as some clays known to the medical profession
of the day are known to have healing qualities. But more
likely the clay was a mere agent to bestir the man, to
awaken him to a sense of himself, and stimulate his nerves
to action&mdash;a mere psychological effect on the man&#8217;s spirit,
something that Jesus, with his unusually keen insight into
men&#8217;s natures, saw was needed. Such cures were often
performed today, by shock of fire or fright, by inducing
the subject to in some way believe that he was healed.
There was a great deal in will power and in the state
of mind, and Jesus used common sense and set men right
with <i>themselves</i>. Perhaps the man had not been really
blind at all from his birth, but had merely got in the habit
of keeping his eyes shut and thinking he was blind, until
he and his friends had come to believe that it was true.
There was much proof for this theory in the way that
his cure was accepted by his friends and neighbors and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
even by his parents. If there had been a real need of
cure it was not at all likely that the parents of the invalid
would have taken the cure so lightly and even professed
that they knew nothing at all about it. The matter was
evidently held lightly among them. The work of Jesus
on this earth was really to bring men to <i>themselves</i>, to
awaken them to a sense of what they could <i>do for themselves</i>,
in even rising above weakness and physical infirmity.
They called Jesus divine because they could find no
better word to call Him, but we were all divine, all the
children of God as was Jesus, and all able to do what
Jesus did. Perhaps not in the same degree, for he was
the greatest man that ever lived, but still, in a sense, we
could do for suffering humanity just what Jesus did. If
we were not actual physicians, able to heal disease, we
could yet persuade men to common sense, awake them
to open their eyes to things about them.</p>

<p>Joyce sat straighter in her seat and her cheeks grew
hot with excitement. She felt as if some exquisite, sacred
fabric, that was beyond price, and had always been most
dear to her had been torn in tatters and scattered to the
four winds. She felt as if she must arise and cry out to
the man that what he was saying was false&mdash;that he
was blaspheming!</p>

<p>She looked around startled on the indifferent audience
composed in a dreamy silence of peace, eyes intent upon
the preacher, lips placid, no look of protest in their faces!
How strange! How awful! Was there no one, not one,
to stand up for the Bible, for the miracle of healing, for
the matchless God-nature of Christ?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>But other words suddenly arrested her, standing out
from the drab background of the sermon sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;The time has come when the world no longer needs
a bloody atonement to appease an angry God. The world
has grown beyond that ghastly idea. The death of Christ
was to show the world how much He loved it, not to
wash away its evil deeds in some mysterious way. People
must undo their own evil deeds. No one could do that
for them. We must work out our own salvation with
fear and trembling, for it was the God in us that works.
We all have God in us, only we are not letting Him work,
just as that blind man had sight, but he was not using it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce almost started to her feet. She seemed to be
crying out in her throat so that it hurt: &#8220;That is not
true, oh, that is not true! Will no one tell him what an
awful thing he is saying?&#8221; But not a sound came from
her lips, of course. She found that her limbs were trembling
and she felt as though she scarcely dared look up.
To think that she was here in God&#8217;s house listening to
this and no one making any protest! She looked around
again, aghast at the smug, satisfied faces of the congregation.
It was almost as if they were not listening.</p>

<p>The minister&#8217;s voice broke again upon her troubled
spirit:</p>

<p>&#8220;No man&#8217;s death can do away with my guilt. No
amount of shed blood can cleanse me from sin. I&#8217;ve got
to do that <i>myself</i>. As Jesus made the man go to the river
and wash the clay away, so you and I must wash away
our own sins in the sweat of our brow, working for Him.
We must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, be kind one
to another, uplift the fallen, uplift and broaden humanity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
put away sin from our lives, and in its place put deeds of
kindness such as Jesus did. That life and that alone can
atone for a sinful past. Let us pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the prayer that followed tears came into the
eyes of the wounded girl, but a choir of the angelic host
seemed somewhere far away to be chanting, and the words
they spoke were clear and distinct:</p>

<p>&#8220;The blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from
all sin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace
was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

<p>&#8220;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned
every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him
the iniquity of us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rang in her heart with triumph as she lifted her
head for the closing song, whose words she could not see
because of the tears in her eyes, and when it was over,
and the benediction was spoken, she turned, humiliated
and sad, to go out of the house of God. Just behind her
came a clear, languid voice, drawling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, wasn&#8217;t it a sweet sermon? Perfectly lovely. I
just love to hear Doctor Darling preach; he is so refined,
and he makes one feel so good&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And out in the sunshine the young girl walked back
to her little house stricken, almost sick, with the experience
of the morning. This was her first experience of Modernism
in a Christian church. Summer visitors in Meadow
Brook had complained that the minister there was old-fashioned,
and they really ought to have a young man
who would be broad in his views and educate the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
people in up-to-date religion. But the people of Meadow
Brook loved Doctor Ballantine and his wife, and did not
want to see them leave. He had been there a long time
and the elders in the church all thought as he did, so
until some of the younger generation who had not been
taught by him in the Scriptures grew up he was not likely
to be ousted.</p>

<p>Joyce had read a little about the state of things in the
religious world, but she had thought of Modernism as
one thinks of leprosy, or the starving Russians, as something
far, far away and awful, to prevent which one ought
to give money and send missionaries, but which one was
never likely to meet with in daily life. Now, suddenly
brought face to face with it, she was shaken to her soul.</p>

<p>Not that the sermon of the morning had given her
any doubts. It could not have done that even if it had
been strong in arguments and logic, and not weak, garbled
statements of half-facts she had known all her life, for
Joyce was a Christian, rooted and grounded in the Word,
and had lived too many years in a sweet communion with
her Saviour to have been shaken even a little in her sweet
faith. No, it had made her angry, tremblingly, impotently
angry. She felt as if she could not stand it that words
like those should have been preached in a Christian pulpit
under the name of an orthodox faith, and no one put in
a protest. She longed to be a man that she might do
something about it, a prophet that she might cry out; a
wise leader that she might come to the people and tell them
how the curse of God would be upon them if they listened
to words like those&mdash;how their souls would be lost&mdash;!</p>

<p>She sat down on her wooden box in her small home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
going over it all with sorrowing heart. She did not even
take off her hat, so absorbed and excited she was. She
went over the Bible verses that she knew that proved the
minister had been wrong, verses that she had learned
when a child, and her heart began to swell with triumph
over the wonder and the joy of the salvation that was hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that
sent me, <i>hath</i> everlasting life, and <i>shall not</i> come into condemnation;
but is passed from death unto life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For by the works of the law shall no flesh be
justified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that
not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works,
lest any man should boast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling,
not according to our works, but according to his own
purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus
before the world began.&#8221;</p>

<p>How her heart thrilled with the words as she said
them over, and how she rejoiced that she had been taught
in the Word. Sunday after Sunday during her little girlhood
it had been the regular afternoon employment for
her and Aunt Mary to learn a chapter in the Bible, or a
group of verses that Aunt Mary had selected during the
week on some special topic. Sometimes she had done the
selecting herself and had taken such joy in finding out a
group of verses on a certain topic. Now they came flocking
from her fine memory like a troop of strong angels
sent to protect her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by works of righteousness which we have done,
but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ
our Saviour.&#8221;</p>

<p>How she wished she had her Bible that she might
spend the afternoon hunting out other verses! What else
was there about the blood? Ah!</p>

<p>&#8220;Without the shedding of blood there is no remission
of sins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For this is my blood of the new testament, which
is shed for many for the remission of sins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while
we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then,
being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from
wrath through him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes
of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purity
of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ,
who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without
spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to
serve the living God.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could remember the very afternoon when she
learned that, curled up on the foot of Aunt Mary&#8217;s bed
while she took a little nap, in the days when Aunt Mary
was just beginning to be frail and had to rest more than
usual. And how proud she had been to think she had
found this wonderful verse all by herself. And now she
had an inexpressible longing to take that Bible verse to
the minister who had preached that strange dead sermon
that morning and show him. Perhaps he didn&#8217;t know.
Perhaps he never had heard. But of course he must.
And he was one of those men they called Modernists, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
were taking the heart and life out of the faith of today,
who were helping to fulfill the prophecies about the latter
days, when men would prefer teachers with strange
doctrines.</p>

<p>She was half frightened at the thought. It seemed
to her that she must turn and flee back into the safe harbor
of Meadow Brook, where dear old Doctor Ballantine
preached about the cross of Christ every Sunday, and
everybody knew and believed the old doctrines. It seemed
as if perhaps she had run away into danger and horror,
and the tempter might be preparing a snare for her feet.</p>

<p>She did not feel safe until she had dropped upon her
knees and asked for guidance and strength to keep true
to Christ, even though she might have to pass through a
portion of the world where there was no faith.</p>

<p>As she rose from her knees it occurred to her that
Elijah, the prophet, had once got into some such a panic,
and thought he was the only loyal prophet left, and the
Lord had told him he had yet five thousand other prophets
who would not bow the knee to Baal. There were very
likely many Christians in this town, and by and by she
would go out and find them.</p>

<p>So she got up cheerfully and went about getting some
dinner. She hadn&#8217;t a great appetite, for she had worn
herself out for several days past, and when she had eaten
she lay down on the heap of papers and fell asleep. When
she awoke she realized that that paper bed was getting
pretty hard, and she really must do something about it
tomorrow; one could not sleep on newspapers indefinitely.
She shook the papers out, and crumpled them anew, until
they had some spring in them again, and smoothed it nicely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
for when she should come back that night, and then, with
a couple of crackers and some cheese folded neatly in a
bit of wrapping-paper and tucked in her pocket, she
started out.</p>

<p>Her first object was to find a church. She wasn&#8217;t
quite sure how she was going to tell whether it was the
right kind of a church from the outside or not, without
listening to another sermon, but she prayed in her heart
as she went that somehow she might drop into a place
where she would find help and comfort to her soul, and
might, if possible, find it without having to listen to
more words such as she had heard that morning. It
seemed to her that it was disloyal to her Lord even to
listen to such things.</p>

<p>The day was wonderful, and the spring air was sweet
with the breath of flowers. As she walked down the
pleasant streets the blueness of the sky and the greenness
of the grass made a kind of ecstasy for her spirit. The
little lazy clouds floating, the flight of a bird across the
blue, the redness of the maple buds on the trees, all gave
her joy. There were tulips in some of the yards she
passed, red and yellow, pink and white; and hyacinths
made delicate the air, and she thought what a wonderful
God to make so many beautiful, intricate flowers, each
with a different perfume. Little blue crocuses were sticking
up their gallant buds from lawns here and there,
quaint processions of blue and white and yellow. The
town was in its Sunday best, and everything promising
a gorgeous summer. One could not help being glad on
such a day even though one were all alone.</p>

<p>A church steeple loomed ahead and Joyce quickened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
her step. It was a plainer church than the one she had
attended in the morning and she thought as she approached,
perhaps here she would find a company of live Christians
who were awake to what was being preached in the other
church and would have the good old gospel. Her eyes
eagerly sought the bulletin-board posted up just outside
the door. The hours of service were there, the usual
hours, but everything else was completely covered by a
large card announcing the Brotherhood Minstrel Show
to be held on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings
of that week, tickets fifty cents a night.</p>

<p>Joyce turned away disappointed. The minstrel show
might be all right. They had entertainments at home
sometimes, of course, for the young people, but people
who were really alive to the terrible things that were
being preached in another church of their own town would
surely be interested in something besides minstrel shows.
Of course they might be, and just not have put it on
the outside of the church, but she didn&#8217;t somehow feel
that here was her place of worship.</p>

<p>She walked on for at least a mile, passing, as she did
so, out of one suburb into another. She was interested
in the pretty little bungalows she passed, and in the finer
houses when she turned to another street, but she was
looking for churches. Presently she came to another, a
smart yellow brick affair out on the street with the doors
open and a brisk air of business around the place. Groups
of young people were wending their way toward it, and
going in the door. A large blackboard outside the entrance
announced the various activities of the week. Monday
evening there was a rehearsal for the Christian Endeavor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
pageant, and all costumes were to be brought, Tuesday
evening Class A was holding a bazaar and supper for the
benefit of the new basketball team. Wednesday evening
there was to be a lecture by a professor from a famous
university entitled, &#8220;Why I Know That the World is
Growing Better.&#8221; Thursday there was a choir rehearsal,
and a meeting of the Ladies&#8217; Aid to arrange to co&ouml;perate
with the Red Cross for the annual fair, Friday there
was a church social, and Saturday there was a picnic in
one of the amusement parks with a moonlight ride home
in automobiles. Joyce read it carefully through, searching
in vain for a word that would show the faith of these
people of great activities, but found nothing, not even a
prayer meeting. Probably that lecture was in place of
one. Well, it might be all right, but she had been taught
that the world wasn&#8217;t growing better, and never would
till Christ came to make things over. Lifting her eyes
above the blackboard, she saw that the church bulletin
announced the minister&#8217;s topic for that night, &#8220;The Political
Situation Today.&#8221; She turned away with a sigh. Well,
it might be all right, but it promised nothing from the
outside. She walked on, turning down another street.</p>

<p>Two hours she walked, keeping the general direction
of her home in mind so that she would not get lost. She
found several little churches, all more or less attractive
in a way, but none of them giving any clue to what was
preached inside, and at last, with a heavy heart and weary
feet, she turned her steps homeward, coming back by a
different street.</p>

<p>It was when she was within four or five blocks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
where she judged her little house must be that she came
upon another church built of rough stone, rugged and substantial,
but beautiful in its simple lines. The door was
open and a burst of song from young voices greeted her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent">Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</div>
<div class="verse">What can make me whole again?</div>
<div class="indent">Nothing but the blood of Jesus.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Joyce turned in at the door as a bird flies home to
its nest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man called Teneyke had decided to give his
confidence to Cottar. He had reached the limit of his
detective powers and needed aid. All research in the way
of telephone books and directories of the region round
about Meadow Brook had failed to bring forth any one
whose name fitted the letters of the paper which he treasured
carefully, wrapped in clean tissue paper and further
enshrined in a dirty envelope, in his inside pocket.</p>

<p>He sought Cottar early in the evening in his own
home, a dull little clapboard house with a side gate and
a brick walk. The front door was always locked and
one entered by the kitchen door at the side into a room
lighted by a kerosene lamp on a little high shelf, and
misty with the smoke of Cottar&#8217;s pipe. Cottar&#8217;s old wife
was deaf as a post, and went pottering round with a little
shoulder shawl across her neck and took no notice of
anybody. When Teneyke came in Cottar signed to her and
she lit a candle and went up a shallow stairway into the
wall. One could hear her shuffling tread overhead. The
two men waited till the boards overhead stopped creaking.
Then Cottar lifted his bushy eyebrows, and let his
beady, wise little eyes peer out speculatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Tyke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyke got out the paper and unwrapped it. Cottar
put on his spectacles. Together they silently studied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
writing. &#8220;oyce Radw.&#8221; It seemed to mean nothing to Cottar
at first. But Tyke produced a page filched from a public
telephone book. There were three R&#8217;s that might have
been possible, Radwan, Radwanski, and Radwell. The
shrewd Cottar decided that the first two were too foreign.
The handwriting looked plain and well formed, not as
he thought a foreigner would write. Radwell might be
the name. He could think of no other. The first name
they decided must be Boyce, although that was a boy&#8217;s
name and not a girl&#8217;s, and would, if correct, throw them
off the track altogether. Perhaps it was a middle name.
So they speculated.</p>

<p>Cottar made a careful, painstaking copy of the writing
and folded it away in his grimy pocket for further
use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t figger it out <i>yet</i>, but there&#8217;s ways. If
she&#8217;s a Meadow Brook dame we&#8217;ll find her out. Just keep
yer mouth shet an&#8217; yer eyes open an&#8217; most things comes
out. Gimme time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Came a tap on the door, and Bill entered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Man, I had a hard time findin&#8217; ye!&#8221; he said, casting
a furtive glance about with his restless, bloodshot eyes.
&#8220;Hey there, Tyke, I thought you got pinched!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, me! Think again, Bill. Take a slicker guy&#8217;n
that cop to lay hands on me. I double crossed him, I
did. Seen Taney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. Got him hid in the Hazels down on the Point.
Gonta watch all night. Taney&#8217;s all right fer that. He&#8217;s
on the job. Nothin&#8217; won&#8217;t get by him. We figger this
would be the night fer another lot to land there if they
had any sorta greement about it. There ain&#8217;t no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
spot this side o&#8217; the lights, an&#8217; he&#8217;s bound to connect along
this coast somewheres. He ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; fur away, you
needn&#8217;t think. He&#8217;s got his good buyers all around this
part. No sir, he thinks he&#8217;s got us buffaloed all right
with that there two hundred bucks, an&#8217; now he&#8217;s figgerin&#8217;
to work it alone, the young devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Been to the cem&#8217;try, Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. Went this a.m. fore dawn. Jest light &#8217;nough
t&#8217;see t&#8217;spade. Opened her all up. Nothin&#8217; there but a
bed of broken glass. Slick job! Cleaned the whole thing
out. Must think we&#8217;re takin&#8217; nourishment out of a bottle
yet, we can&#8217;t see through that. Say, boys, whaddaya say
we take a little trip through the ole buryin&#8217; ground up by
the state road? He&#8217;s bound to get another location fer
his business, an&#8217; that&#8217;s good an&#8217; lonely. I found out he&#8217;s
got a sister an&#8217; she&#8217;s got some kids. Be a good idee to
buddy up to &#8217;em, Tyke. You&#8217;re good at that business.
They live down to Meadow Brook on Orchard Street,
third house from the corner, opposite to the garage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyke narrowed his eyes and nodded.</p>

<p>The next day Tyke happened along Orchard Street as
Lib Knox was starting to school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer uncle at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>She eyed him shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whaddaya wanta know for?&#8221; she demanded, cold-eyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wantta see him on a message.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he ain&#8217;t in,&#8221; she said loftily. &#8220;You better
leave the message.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started down the street with her armful of books,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
and Dorothea, approaching from the corner, joined her.
Tyke followed them and lounged along beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, kid,&#8221; he said, bringing out the greasy envelope,
&#8220;donno but I will. I c&#8217;n confide in you. I see you&#8217;re
a pretty good sort o&#8217; kid. Looka here!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lib Knox was not the easily flattered sort. She
eyed him with suspicion, and looked coldly at the bit of
paper he held out to her. When she caught sight of the
writing her eyes narrowed and she gave him a quick,
veiled glance beneath their fringes. Dorothea, behind her,
as ever curious, stretched her neck to see the writing also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know whose name that is?&#8221; The man asked the
question with alluring mystery in his tone, as if he knew
the name himself and had some wonderful information
to impart concerning it. But Lib was a smart girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look like any name at all to me,&#8221; she said
contemptuously. &#8220;Looks like just a piece of writing.
Where&#8217;d you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; till I find out what you know
about it. If you can tell me the name I&#8217;ll tell you something
your uncle would like real well to know. Most
like he&#8217;ll give you a box of candy if you tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lib tossed her head angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My uncle ain&#8217;t that kind and I can get candy when
I want it. I tell you that ain&#8217;t anybody&#8217;s name at all. It&#8217;s
just scribbling. Come on, Dorrie, we&#8217;ll be late to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dorothea had got a good vision of the writing
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s my cousin&#8217;s name!&#8221; she exclaimed
eagerly, wondering if she could possibly get that box of
candy. &#8220;Joyce Ra&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>But a firm little hand was laid smotheringly over her
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; said Lib Knox fiercely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
know you mustn&#8217;t talk to strange men on the street? Come
on, I hear the last bell ringing&mdash;&#8221; and she seized her young
slave and dragged her at full tilt down the street.</p>

<p>Tyke stood still on the pavement, his red hair reflecting
the morning sun, and his unholy face broad with a leer
of triumph. Let them go. He had his clue, Joyce! Strange
he hadn&#8217;t thought of that name before. Even when he
used the whole alphabet, somehow he didn&#8217;t figure out
that name. The rest would be easy to get. He sauntered
down after the flying children and noted the location of
the school house. School would be out at noon of course&mdash;or
would afternoon be better? Ah, there was a tall hedge
across the way, an excellent point of vantage to watch
as the children filed out at the end of the day.</p>

<p>And so it happened, quite late in the afternoon after
Lib Knox and Dorothea had written their misspelled words
five hundred times and stayed in an extra half-hour for
talking deaf and dumb language in class, and when they
had visited the public garage for an hour and played with
the five blind puppies that had recently arrived there, and
had said a lingering and fond farewell for the afternoon
and parted, that Dorothea started on her reluctant way
home to supper.</p>

<p>As she turned the corner out of sight of Lib Knox,
Tyke stepped up as if he had just been walking down
that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, kid,&#8221; he said in his insinuating way. &#8220;I jest
been lookin&#8217; fer you. Bought that box of candy awhile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
ago an&#8217; thought I&#8217;d like to give it to you. You like chocolates,
don&#8217;t you, kid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorothea quickly assured him that she did, her eyes
round with eagerness.</p>

<p>He produced a pound box tied with a red ribbon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a nice kid,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I knowed
it the minute I saw you. So that girl was your cousin,
was she? Joyce, wha did ya say her name was? I ferget
without the writin&#8217; in front of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce Radway,&#8221; eagerly supplied Dorothea, her eyes
on the candy box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it, Joyce Radway. Of course. How did
I come to ferget that? Well, now this Joyce Radway,
she&#8217;s a great friend of that other girl&#8217;s uncle, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I guess so,&#8221; said Dorothea. &#8220;He came to the
house to see her the other night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he did, did he? Yes, of course he would. Then
your cousin is home, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221; insinuatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she ain&#8217;t home, not now,&#8221; said Dorothea, annoyed,
wondering when he was going to give her the
box. &#8220;She&#8217;s gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! She has?&#8221; his eyes narrowed as he watched
her. &#8220;Did she go away with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Dorothea garrulously. &#8220;She just went
away by herself. She was mad. Daddy scolded her, and
she just went.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said the young man ingratiatingly, fumbling
with the red ribbon as if he were about to untie it. &#8220;Suppose
you tell me all about it, and then I&#8217;ll give you the
candy. You say your daddy scolded her? What for?
Didn&#8217;t he like the boys coming to see her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Dorothea quite earnestly, trying to
think how to answer so she would get the candy quickly.
&#8220;She never had any boys. It was just the &#8217;lectric light.
Daddy said she burned it too much, and he didn&#8217;t like her
taking &#8217;zaminations and all. Where&#8217;dya get the candy?
I saw a box like that down to the drug store.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s where I got it. It&#8217;s good candy. I suppose
you&#8217;ll give your cousin some when you get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she hasn&#8217;t come home. I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; said the
little girl with virtuous satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t got home? Why, where is she?&#8221; plied her
questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we don&#8217;t know. Daddy&#8217;s most crazy. Say, if
you know where she is you better tell me, fer there&#8217;s something
&#8217;bout her having to be home for Judge Peterson to
read the will and give us our house. Do you know where
cousin Joyce is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I might be able to find out, kiddie,&#8221; said the
oily voice. &#8220;Where do you live? You tell me where you
live and I&#8217;ll let you know if I find she&#8217;s in the place I think
she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I live right up there in that white house with
green blinds,&#8221; said Dorothea eagerly. &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d
let me know tonight. I&#8217;ll come out to the gate and wait
for you if you will. Daddy would be awful pleased with
me if I told him where Joyce was. I think he&#8217;d get me
a new bicycle if I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see what can be done,&#8221; said Tyke
wickedly. &#8220;Here&#8217;s yer candy, kid, and p&#8217;raps ye&#8217;ll hear
from me soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyke handed over the candy and Dorothea flew home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
pausing behind the lilac bush to extract one luscious mouthful
from the box, then rushing up to her room to secrete
the rest where Junior would not find it, under the mattress
of her bed.</p>

<p>Tyke went on his evil way rejoicing. Shrewd little
Lib Knox saw him as he passed her house and scuttled
behind the hedge, sticking out her tongue behind his back
as he passed, and thought she had frustrated his intentions,
while five blocks away Dorothea was gorging herself on
Dutch creams and wondering why Lib didn&#8217;t like that
nice young man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> weeks later found Joyce well established in her
comfortable little home, and spending her mornings teaching
in a summer Bible School connected with the church
which she found that first Sunday evening of her stay
in Silverdale.</p>

<p>It all came about in this way:</p>

<p>Christian Endeavor was in session when she entered
the church and an enthusiastic set of young people were
conducting it. The pastor sat in front near the leader
in pleasant accord with all that went on. He seemed to
be an intimate friend of every boy and girl present. Joyce
looked on wistfully. This was like home. Doctor Ballantine
had been like that with all the young people of
the town.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting he made several announcements.
One which interested Joyce was that there was
need of another teacher in the Bible School to take the
place of Miss Brown, who had recently lost her health
and been obliged to go away for a year. He told them to
remember that it meant giving every morning for five
days in the week for six weeks to actual teaching and
some time to preparing for teaching; that there was a
remuneration of ten dollars a week for the work; but that
no one need apply who was not a Christian, or did not intend
to be present at every session, or who had not had
some experience and preparation for teaching.</p>

<p>The pastor, by some magic, was at the door as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
as the meeting was over, and took her hand cordially in
welcome. She looked into his grave, pleasant face and
impulsively spoke the wish that had been in her heart
since she had heard the announcement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so interested in your Bible School! I wish
I could teach in it, but I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;d care to try
a stranger, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The minute she had spoken the color flooded her face,
for she felt as if she had been presumptuous, but the minister&#8217;s
eyes lighted and he smiled in a kindly way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a Christian?&#8221; he asked, his pleasant eyes
searching her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Joyce, with a proud ring to her voice
as if he had asked her if she were the daughter of some
great man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever taught in public school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joyce wistfully, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve been preparing
to teach for several years. I love it. I&#8217;m hoping to
get a position near here this fall. But I haven&#8217;t any credentials
yet. I would have to take examinations&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and see me tomorrow at my house. Any time.
It&#8217;s right next door to the church. If I don&#8217;t happen to
be there Mrs. Lyman will talk with you. It&#8217;s all the same.
Can you come at nine o&#8217;clock? Well, I&#8217;ll be there then.
Glad to have you come. Perhaps the Lord has sent you
in answer to our prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Joyce went to see the Lymans and as a result was
engaged to teach in the Bible School, which would begin
as soon as the public schools closed, and be in session for
six weeks. She would have to be at the church at half
past eight and stay until half past eleven. The pay wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
great, but it took only half her day and she loved the
work. She might be able to get something else afternoons
occasionally to help out. In the meantime she could live
on that ten dollars if she had to, and she meant to. As
for the interval before the Bible School opened, there
would be something to do, she was sure. And, anyhow,
the barrel of meal hadn&#8217;t wasted yet, and she felt sure
the Lord would take care of her. Besides, she needed
some time to fix up her little home and make it liveable.
One couldn&#8217;t just exist if one was working, one had to
have things tolerably comfortable for resting and eating
or one couldn&#8217;t do good work.</p>

<p>So she went back to her little house and sat down
to think. The conclusion of her meditation was that she
decided to buy a saw.</p>

<p>Consulting Mrs. Bryant that Monday morning, she
finally decided on a trip to the city, and armed with minute
directions about stores and prices, she took the noon train.</p>

<p>Her first purchase was a Bible.</p>

<p>She had asked about a book-store where things would
not be expensive and Mrs. Bryant had named a second-hand
place where things were very nice and very cheap,
she said. Joyce found a Scofield Bible, new and clean,
and scarcely used at all, it seemed. It had an inscription
on the fly-leaf, &#8220;To Mary, from Mother, December
25, 1922.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce felt a pitiful joy in buying that particular Bible.
It seemed so sorrowful that a Bible from a mother to
her child should be lying out in the open on a book-stall
like that, and only two years after it was given. What
if it had been hers from her mother? What if it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
been Aunt Mary&#8217;s Bible! She fell to wondering about
that other Mary. Was she dead, or didn&#8217;t she care about
the book? Were they both dead, mother and child, in those
two brief years? How did a precious, intimate thing like
a Bible get to be sold in a second-hand store? It seemed
almost indecent. Surely some relative or even a trustee
who had to sell things at auction would have had the
decency to give a Bible to some friend who would care
for it, or to some mission that would use it for the glory
of God. So she bought the Bible and carried it tenderly
with a thought for its unknown owner and donor.</p>

<p>Joyce had a great many bundles when she had finished
her purchases. She looked at them in amazement when
she finally settled herself in the train once more for her
return trip to Silverdale. She really had spent very little
money for all those big packages. She began to count up.
The Bible had cost fifty cents, and she knew it was very
cheap. The saw was a dollar and a half, but it was the
best of steel. There was a big bundle of gray denim for
upholstery. She had got it at a reduced rate by taking
all that was left of the piece. Two or three yards of
flowered cretonne to cover her box dressing table. Perhaps
she could have waited for that, but it wasn&#8217;t good
policy for her to seem too poverty-stricken if she expected
to get a position in school, and what she bought must be
the right thing so that she would not have to renew it
right away. She must make her little house look cosy if
the minister and his wife dropped in to call, or any of those
nice young people at the church should run in.</p>

<p>That big, bulky package with the handle contained a
lot of wire springs, some upholstery webbing, and twine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
a long, double-pointed upholstery needle, and several
pounds of curled hair and cheap cotton. This constituted
Joyce&#8217;s venture. With it she meant to make a bed and
perhaps two chairs. Maybe it was foolish, and she ought
to have bought a cot for five dollars and let it go at that,
but she would have had to buy a mattress or something
to put over it, and when it was done it would not be so
comfortable as one that she could make. For Joyce had
often watched an old neighbor of theirs in Meadow Brook
who was an upholsterer. She knew all the little tricks.
She knew how the webbing should be nailed on taut, how
the springs must be sewed to the webbing, and then tied
down level, and the padding of cotton and hair put on
the top of that. She was sure she could do it, though she
had never tried it. Joyce was not beyond trying anything
if necessity drove her to it. She had once made a
lovely feather fan out of chicken feathers and an old
ivory frame. She felt she could make a bedstead if she
tried hard enough. There was yet the frame to be dealt
with, but she had her saw, and anyhow, the springs and
webbing and hair had cost but very little, and it would
surely be much more comfortable than a hard cot, besides
looking a great deal better in her room, and costing no
more than, nor as much as, a cot.</p>

<p>She had bought a few necessities for her wardrobe also,
a couple of remnants to make more thin dresses, a pair of
fifty-cent slippers from the bargain counter to save her
shoes while she was working. In fact, most of her purchases
were from the bargain counters, a hair-brush and
comb, a change of undergarments and night wear, two
pairs of stockings, and some towels. What a lot of things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
one needed to live! And when she counted up there was
just twenty-four dollars and eighty-seven cents left of
her small capital. It made her gasp as she thought of the
weeks ahead before her engagement in the Bible School
would commence, and how was she to live? She must
be very, very economical. But yet she need not be afraid.
The barrel of meal had not wasted so far. God would
take care of her, and her heart began to sing as she remembered
how He had brought her safely so far out of
her difficulties.</p>

<p>Then when she got home she was hailed by Mrs.
Bryant. Mrs. Ritter, down the street, wanted to know if
Joyce would be willing to come in and sit with her sister
for the evening. She had made an engagement to go to
the city with her husband, and now her sister was sick
and she didn&#8217;t like to leave her alone in the house. There
was really nothing to do but give her her medicine every
hour and answer the telephone and the door bell. Mrs.
Ritter would be glad to pay her for her time, fifty cents
an hour was what she thought would be fair. She wouldn&#8217;t
be home till the midnight train, but Mr. Ritter would walk
down with her after they got back, so she needn&#8217;t be afraid
to come home.</p>

<p>Joyce thanked Mrs. Bryant for speaking of her. She
said of course she would go, and went about her little
house with shining eyes, singing. The barrel of meal
was filling up again. How wonderful! There would be
three more dollars! She had taken a good dinner in the
city at an automat restaurant which Mrs. Bryant had
recommended, and she did not feel the need of an elaborate
meal that night. So she drank some milk and finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
her crackers and cheese, rolled up one of the remnants
with her scissors and thimble and thread, and started out
to Mrs. Ritter&#8217;s. If all went well she might be able to
get another dress started during the evening.</p>

<p>The next day she invested in some boards and went
to work sawing. It was rather rough work, and she got
splinters in her hands and sawed some of the joints a bit
crookedly, but she finally put some very creditable corners
together, sawing off parts of each and dovetailing
them into one another as she had seen carpenters do,
until she had a good, strong framework a little over six
feet long and thirty inches wide, which was the size of
the space in which she could put her bed without running
across the windows.</p>

<p>When she had satisfied herself that the framework
was strong she began nailing webbing across the bottom,
interlacing it rather closely, as she had seen old Mr. Carpenter
do. When it was finished she lifted the structure
upon two boxes and sewed the springs into place at regular
distances.</p>

<p>It took two days to get those springs tied down satisfactorily
on a perfect level, and Joyce had several pricked
fingers before she was done, and was almost wishing she
had bought a hard little army cot and learned to enjoy
it. But the third morning she covered the springs with
a layer of cheap cloth, then the cotton, and lastly the hair,
covering the whole with ticking. Then, with her big
needle, she tied this down at every three or four inches,
until she had a soft, firm mattress, fine enough for a
princess. The work really, though crude in some ways,
was a great success, and one to be proud of, and when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
was done she put it on the floor and threw herself down
upon it with a great sigh of relief. Now, at last, she
had a spot where the tired would be taken out of her when
she had worked to the limit of her strength, something to
look forward to when she came to her lonely little house
at night after a hard day.</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Bryant had managed to do a good
deal of talking in the neighborhood about the bright young
teacher who had come there to live and was having a little
spare time this summer to help people out in an emergency,
and several calls had come for her.</p>

<p>Once she had had to drop her hammer and saw and
go to help Mrs. Smith to finish canning cherries, and succeeded
in being so satisfactory that she was engaged to
help with the strawberry preserves, gooseberry jam, and
currant jelly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jennings, on the next block, heard of her and
engaged an afternoon a week at fifty cents an hour to take
care of her children while she went out to the club meeting,
and sometimes an extra evening. During these evenings
she got quite a lot of sewing done, gradually acquiring a
complete little wardrobe of plain, simple clothing made
all by hand, but quite serviceable and pretty.</p>

<p>She met the gray-haired librarian of the Silverdale
Memorial Library, and was asked to come in and help
with the new cataloging. This took several afternoons and
evenings, and meanwhile the furnishings of her little home
grew slowly.</p>

<p>Once she was called in for three days to take care
of some children while their mother went to the hospital
for an operation on her throat; and several times after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
that she went to help nurse some one in a slight illness,
where training was not required. She began to be known
as the &#8220;Emergency Girl,&#8221; and thought about putting out
a sign and getting a telephone.</p>

<p>Meantime, she had met a kindly old man who was on
the School Board, and had arranged to take examinations
and put in her application for a position should any be
vacant for the next winter. This necessitated the purchase
of some books, and another trip to the second-hand
book-store.</p>

<p>She had been living most economically, getting one
meal a day usually, at a little restaurant among the stores
where the tradespeople ate, and good wholesome food
could be had at most reasonable rates. This gave her
always something hot once a day. For the rest, she was
living on ready-to-eat cereals, fruit, bread and butter,
and milk, or if it rained too hard to go out she would cook
an egg on her little alcohol can and eat her dinner at home.
It really cost very little to live when one was careful. As
for heat and light, she did not need either at this time
of year. A candle did for emergencies. The twilight
was long, and the electric light in the street was quite
enough to go to bed by. Often she was out at somebody&#8217;s
house for the evening, caring for a child or an old person
while the family amused themselves in the city, and there
was always plenty of time then to read or study or sew.</p>

<p>So her life had settled into a pleasant little groove with
interesting prospects ahead, and still the &#8220;barrel of meal,&#8221;
as she called her worn little pocketbook, always contained
enough to live upon and get the real necessities, and sometimes
a fragment or two of luxury. Winter was coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
sometime, of course, with need for heat and light, and
she must prepare for it too, but it wasn&#8217;t here yet. Still,
she did not feel that she had arrived at the point where
she cared to let the Meadow Brook people know where
she was. Some of them might take it into their heads
to hunt her up on a motor trip, and she wasn&#8217;t just prepared
yet to show off her little house. Besides, she wanted
to be anchored firmly with a regular school job before she
told any one where she was. Well, she knew there were
people in Meadow Brook who would gladly have offered
her a home just for Aunt Mary&#8217;s sake, and she was a
proud little girl and didn&#8217;t want to have anybody feel
they must offer her help. Besides, it wasn&#8217;t exactly loyal
to the family to explain her position at present, and she
was one who would be loyal to her family even if her
family were not loyal to her.</p>

<p>So she went her various helpful ways, and eked out
her small necessities, with always something in the little
brown pocketbook. Day by day the little house grew more
homelike and cosy.</p>

<p>The home-made bed was a wonderful success. Mounted
on four solid little square boxes six inches high, and nailed
firmly to them, with a valance and cover of gray denim,
and cotton pillows covered with the same, it seemed a luxurious
couch. At night when the cover was removed it
made a wonderful bed. When Joyce finally attained a
fluffy pink comfortable made of cotton batting and a
remnant of pink cheese cloth tied with pink yarn, she felt
that she slept in luxury. Sheets and pillow-cases were
not expensive when one bought remnants of coarse cloth
and hemmed them; and washing was not hard to do with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
the outside faucet and drain so near. It might not be so
easy in winter, but it was all right in summer. And presently
Mrs. Bryant made it still easier for her by suggesting
that she use the tubs and hot water in the laundry in return
for helping her out by getting supper once in a while when
she had company.</p>

<p>Gradually the little house in the side yard took on an
atmosphere of home. The two barrels, sawed in the
middle half around, fitted with four springs in the seats,
and upholstered in gray denim with padded backs and
valanced standards, became two easy chairs, really comfortable
to sit in. Joyce was proud of them. She invited
Mrs. Bryant to take a seat in one when it was finished,
and that good lady was almost disposed to doubt the
girl&#8217;s word when she told her it was made out of a barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandmother made one,&#8221; explained Joyce, &#8220;and
we always kept it carefully. I often wanted to make
one when I saw a nice clean barrel, and now I&#8217;ve done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think you&#8217;re a wonder,&#8221; said Mrs. Bryant,
after she had lifted the valance and felt the sturdy barrel
staves for herself. &#8220;Just a wonder! You get so much
more out of life than those flapper girls do! I wonder they
like to be such fools. I can&#8217;t see what the boys see in
them. My Jimmie don&#8217;t like &#8217;em. He says, &#8216;Mother,
you don&#8217;t know what the girls are like nowadays,&#8217; and I
believe him. I&#8217;m sure I hope he stays sensible and finds
a girl some day that will be the right kind. I was most
afraid there weren&#8217;t any left, but now I&#8217;ve seen you I&#8217;m
real encouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>The said Jimmie appeared at home one week-end from
technical school, where he was learning to be an electrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
engineer, and kindly offered to wire her little house
for her, probably at his mother&#8217;s suggestion. So, at last,
she had light and a place to cook, and she saved enough
from getting her own dinners to buy a tiny electric grill,
which gave her great comfort.</p>

<p>One corner which she called her diningroom blossomed
out with shelves, on which little blue and white cups
and plates, bought at the ten-cent store, made quite a
display.</p>

<p>She found a table and two wooden kitchen chairs at
a second-hand store one day and bought the lot for two
dollars, painted them gray, and she had a diningroom
set. The box dressing table had long ago been decked
out in pink-flowered cretonne and made a commodious
harbor for her meagre wardrobe. By and by she would
find a chest of drawers and paint that gray also and then
she would be fixed.</p>

<p>The only thing that really troubled her when she
stopped to think was how she was going to keep the place
warm when winter came. And presently that problem,
too, was solved, for Jimmie, hearing of the difficulty on
one of his week-ends at home, suggested that he would
build her a chimney out of the big pile of stones on the
back of his father&#8217;s lot, with a fireplace of stone in the
room. If that didn&#8217;t give her heat enough in the middle
of winter she could get a little coal stove and set it up
in one corner with a pipe into the chimney. Thereafter
every Saturday when he came home he worked for several
hours on the chimney, in return for which Joyce helped
him with his mathematics for the next week, so that she
did not feel he was making her chimney for nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>By the time the Vacation Bible School opened Joyce
felt quite at home in the church of her choice, and was
growing shyly intimate with Mrs. Lyman, the minister&#8217;s
wife. They had given her the primary department, and
when she arrived at the church on the opening morning
of the Bible School, she found that there were forty-nine
little midgets, not one of them over five years old, all
ready and eager to study the Bible. Joyce, with reverent
heart, set about her glorious task, praying that she
might be allowed to lay the foundation of belief in Christ
and the Holy Scriptures even while they were so young.
She entered into her work with eagerness and was inclined
to spend even more time than she was required in
preparing for each day&#8217;s work, it was all such a joy to her.</p>

<p>But, sometimes, when she lay on the soft couch alone
in her little toy house at night, and the streets were still
save for the night watchman&#8217;s whistle now and again in
the distance, and the electric light flickered softly over her
white wall, and played tricks of design on her curtains
and draperies, she thought of the days at home with Aunt
Mary, and how different it all would be if her precious
aunt could have been with her here. How she longed
to tell her everything that had happened, and talk over
each day&#8217;s doings just as she used to do. The loneliness
was inexpressible, and the tears would come. Then her
heart would go back to the dear home where she had
spent so many years, and familiar faces would come back,
and little happenings, till she felt as if she could not bear
it, being away like this. And then she would remember
Nan and Gene and how hard the days had been before
she left, and knew that she had done the wisest thing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
going, and that God had set his seal upon her choice by
prospering her in her way.</p>

<p>But always, when she had one of these times of retrospect,
she did not fail to remember the boy who had spent
that happy day with her and Aunt Mary in the woods
so long ago, and to feel again the pain of that night
when she found him and knew that somehow he had been
doing something unworthy. Then she would pray with
all her heart, as indeed she prayed every night, for him,
that he might be converted and get to know Jesus Christ.
Indeed, this was the great prayer of her life, the one
big desire that her heart had set above all other desires.
And as the days went by and she prayed for it, she grew
gradually to feel that somehow it would be accomplished.
She might never see, might never even know on this earth
that it had been done, but she had faith to believe it would
be done because the Bible said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If ye ask anything in my name, I will do it,&#8221; and
because He also said, &#8220;It is not his will that <i>any</i> should
perish; but that <i>all</i> should come to repentance.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so she came to feel that some day her friend would
find the way, and that perhaps, sometime in a heavenlier
sphere, she would see him again with the smile of
a reconciled God reflected in his face. And her heart
was comforted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Darcy Sherwood</span> had dropped out of Meadow Brook
life as completely, apparently, as if he had died.</p>

<p>His old friends and associates did not realize it at
first, thought he was gone on one of his short trips, or
had taken on a new operation of some sort. Nobody ever
seemed to know just what Darcy&#8217;s business was, only
that nobody ever spoke of him as one who had no business.
He was one who kept his mouth shut about his
own affairs, and much as his friends would have liked
to ask him questions, they seldom did. If they did they
were surprised to find that, although he answered them
pleasantly, they had gained very little real knowledge of
what they had started out to investigate.</p>

<p>People talked about him, as people always will talk
about those they do not understand, and they said a great
many things about him that were not true, while things
that they did not say or think about him, things that
were, some of them, worse than those they did think,
were very often true.</p>

<p>Darcy had a strange code of honor and of life.</p>

<p>He was the product of a naturally loving disposition
left to come up without much training, left to experiment
with life for himself, and to search out his own view of
the universe and his own doctrines of right and wrong.
There were certain things he would not do though heaven
and hell were against him, because he had decided in his
heart that they were not right&mdash;not &#8220;square,&#8221; he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
it. One was that he never would harm a woman or a
child in any way, directly or indirectly, if he knew it;
and another was that he must always help the downtrodden,
sometimes without regard to whether their cause was
right or wrong, according to law and public opinion.</p>

<p>With all this he had the unusual combination of being
both extremely clever as a business man, and entirely
unselfish in his personal life. Strong beyond most, he
could walk among pitch when he liked without being soiled,
yet he often chose to play with that pitch and minded not
if others saw it on his hands, or misunderstood his actions.
Beautiful as the devil must have been before he fell,
with dark eyes, bronze-gold hair, inclined to curl, and
a smile of more than ordinary beauty, yet sad, too, with
the sadness of the lost sometimes. Nobody quite knew
what it was about Darcy Sherwood that made them like
him so, or just what they so utterly disapproved of. And
he went his way without seeming to care which they did.
Only little children and old women saw the real Darcy,
and won his rare confidence.</p>

<p>Darcy had a brother-in-law after his own heart, who
knew how to keep his mouth shut&mdash;not as clever as Darcy,
not always so good, but much richer in respectability, and
most kind to Darcy&#8217;s sister, a good dull girl who loved
Darcy devotedly, but who never understood him. Sharp
little Lib was a product of this home and her uncle&#8217;s training.
Where she got her sharpness was always a problem to
Darcy. Certainly not from her simple-minded mother,
nor yet from her somewhat commonplace father. Yet
Darcy was fond of them both, and respected their ability
to keep their mouths shut. It was something that Darcy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
had always taught everybody, sooner or later, with whom
he came in contact.</p>

<p>And now Darcy was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be away for awhile, I don&#8217;t know how long.
Business trip. All you know about it, Mase, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mason Knox nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I getcha!&#8221; he said, and went on cleaning the carburetor
of his car.</p>

<p>After awhile his brother-in-law raised his head and
gave Darcy a keen glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything gone wrong, Darcy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mase, nothing wrong. New line, that&#8217;s all.
Been working on the wrong dope, I guess. Going to try
a new line. But first I&#8217;ve got something to do. May
take a long time. May be only a few days. Don&#8217;t let
Ellen worry. I&#8217;ll write if there&#8217;s any need.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went the next day. Mason Knox and Dan Peterson
were the only two in Meadow Brook who knew anything
about his going, and that was all they knew. When
people began to make inquiries Mason Knox answered
with: &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say. He might and he might not be
back soon. That depends.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Dan Peterson heard that Darcy had disappeared
from his usual haunts, heard first through his own son,
who was a devotee of the baseball field on afternoons, he
looked thoughtful, and wise, and went and told his father.</p>

<p>And Darcy had a strange method of going. He did
not take the train, nor buy a ticket. He waited until night&mdash;no
one quite remembered when they saw Darcy Sherwood
last, when it came right down to the question some
months afterward. Even the sharp-eyed Tyke, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
vigilant night and day as soon as his eyes were open to
the necessity, had somehow missed his movements.</p>

<p>Darcy went at night, alone, without baggage or any
impedimenta whatever; first to the graveyard, where he
took from a tangle of grass and weeds under the hedge
on the outer edge of the next field a pick and shovel that
came strangely to hand, and went silently and deftly to a
spot that he seemed to know well.</p>

<p>Here he worked for half an hour or more, lifting sod
and soil from the place and setting them aside, as if he
had done it before, pausing now and again to listen to a
stir in the hedge or to mark the scuttling of a wild rabbit.
Then, after a longer pause than usual, there came the
sound of soft clinking, crashing; the gurgle of liquid coming
through a small aperture, yet muffled, as if it were
flowing underground. For a long time this went on,
while Darcy stood watching the darkness, listening to the
distance, identifying each falling leaf and stir in the
shadows among the weird shafts of marble, and sighing
cedars of the cemetery.</p>

<p>After a time he put back the soil and the sods into
place, laid the pick and the shovel in the bed of a little
creek just over in the next field, where the water tinkled
over it harmlessly and obliterated all finger-marks from
its handle; and then stole away down the road, leaving
behind, in the place of the dead, a strange, penetrating,
unmistakable odor, which by morning would be purged
away and escape into the elements.</p>

<p>Down in the road he paused, where he had encountered
Joyce, and for a moment let his soul feel all that he had
felt then&mdash;the delicacy of her hallowed touch, the thrill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
of her presence so near him, followed by the scorching
shame that she should find him here, and by her question,
with its piercing meaning, its wise conclusion, its
sorrowing rebuke. The deep, wonderful look in her eyes
as the flashlight revealed his identity to her, of recognition
and of hurt surprise&mdash;he felt it all again! The tone of that
voice that from his childhood he had treasured like the
beautiful song of a bird in the holiest place in his heart.
It was almost as if he suddenly felt that for a moment
God was looking at him through her eyes, and he too saw
himself as God saw him, and did not like it.</p>

<p>There was more to it. There was a kind of recoiling
in horror from himself as he suddenly saw that in what
he had been doing he had been untrue to himself and to
his code. He had respected himself for the way he had
kept to his self-made laws, and now his self-respect was
broken. He could not go on and any more take satisfaction
in what he had been doing.</p>

<p>He stood there in the darkness with bowed head and
went over it all again, as he had gone over it a thousand
times since that night when he had seen her go from him
into the dark, and the thought of her had driven him
forth on this quest. Then, still, with bowed head he went
on down the road.</p>

<p>A strange thing happened to him. He seemed to
think as she must have been thinking, to know at each
turn of the road what she would have done, which way
she would have turned.</p>

<p>He knew that she had slept in the hammock, for he
had sent his colleagues away, and taking another way
about to overtake her, had seen her enter the gate, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
watched her through the night until she stole away in the
gray of the morning. So far he knew her way and could
follow the trail.</p>

<p>But when he reached the streets of the little town
beyond and must choose between houses and turning corners
it was not so plain. Yet he had resolved to leave
no clue unfollowed, no spot where she might have turned
unsearched.</p>

<p>He had a plan to make his search complete. He would
make a map of each day&#8217;s wanderings, note each house
and corner and way of egress, choose the most likely
and search it to the end, then come back and choose the
next. It seemed, perhaps, the work of a lifetime, yet he
did not feel that he would be long in finding her. There
was something in his soul that told him he would find
her. He had to find her and tell her what he had been
doing, and that he never would do it again. He had to
absolve his soul from that before her eyes. He could not
lift up his head and respect himself again unless he did.
She had stood like a young saint within the shrine of his
heart, and now he felt cast away from the presence of all
that he held really holy in the world.</p>

<p>So he went step by step over the way that Joyce had
gone, his clever judgment quickly deciding which corner
she would have chosen, where she would have paused, and
how gone on again. And Joyce would have been surprised
to know how far he traced her very steps.</p>

<p>It was not until he reached the city that his way became
bewildering. He had dropped into a number of
homes on his way where people lived who often visited in
Meadow Brook, and casually, as if he had had an accident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
on the road and needed to borrow water or a tool for
his car, which he had left out of sight down the road, he
would put one or two keen questions that would make him
sure she had not passed that way while these people were
about. And so his little note book became filled with tiny
tracings of maps, with streets and corners noted, and each
turning that he had not followed marked for returning
some day in case his quest was not successful.</p>

<p>He thought much as he took his way on foot through
the world, and began to feel himself a pilgrim on a holy
quest, not a knight, for his self-confidence had been too
badly shaken for that. He had not so much the feeling
that she needed him and he could help her to her inheritance
if he found her, as he had the need of her in his soul.
It seemed sometimes that he could not live until he had
unburdened his soul by confession to her and had told
her he would sin that way no more. He wanted her restored
confidence, her clear-eyed smile, the feeling that
she was his friend, though ever so far away, that there
was something sweet and true between them. He had
never thought of her as his in any way except as a guiding
star, but now that he had lost that star, his life seemed
all awry, as if he could not go on without her, as if all
was darkness and horror, that she should think of him
as one so unworthy.</p>

<p>As he thought out his pilgrimage before him it occurred
to him that the churches should be his goal. He knew
that she always went to service, to prayer meetings, and
Sunday School, and morning and evening church gatherings.
There was his key to the situation. If she were still
in the land of the living, if nothing evil had befallen her,
she would be at some place of worship at the time appointed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
And so, when a bell from some steeple rang
a call to worship, he would pause, and wait, and watch
the worshippers till all were in, or if he passed an open
church door he would enter, sit down and gaze about until
he had searched every face, and was sure she was not
there. Then he would quietly get up and leave. Seldom did
he hear the service that went on about him, seldom pretended
to listen. He was there but for one purpose, and
he had no time to waste. Words indeed passed through
his consciousness as they were spoken, in story or song,
but they left no impression there. He was not a scoffer
at religious things. They had simply never touched him.
He stood on the outside of them. Except for that one
afternoon in his life when he had sat in the dim aisles
of the grove and listened to Mary Massey reading the story
of the blind man, he had never really taken heed to the
Bible. Oh, he had heard it read in school, of course, and
now and then in a service that some strange fancy carried
him to as a boy, never in Sunday School, for he had not
been sent there, and it was not a place he would have
chosen to go because it meant confinement in the house
when one might be out-of-doors. He had always been
a law unto himself and he was rather proud of the fact.
Now a great depression was upon him because he felt he
had not kept his own law. It was Joyce&#8217;s clear eyes, her
keen question, that made him see that in breaking the
law of his land, he had broken also the law of that
inner, finer self. It was in his thoughts of her that he
came to see that there was always something behind a law,
it was never just a law.</p>

<p>What was that in Mary Massey&#8217;s prayer so long ago?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>&#8220;Help us for Christ&#8217;s sake to have our eyes open to
sin, so that we shall always know when we are not pleasing
Thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been long years since he had heard that first
and only real prayer of his lifetime, for other prayers
that he had happened to hear had meant nothing to him,
but the words of this were as clear to him as if it had
been heard only yesterday. He pondered on the words
as he walked down the highways on his search. &#8220;To have
one&#8217;s eyes open to sin, so that one should always know&mdash;&#8221;
That had been his trouble. Strange! He had prided himself
on never making mistakes, on keeping his code in
mind, and yet what he had been doing had not seemed
to be hurting any one, and it was not until that clear-eyed
girl had been a witness of his deeds in the darkness that
he had felt the conviction. There had been something like
that in the story her aunt had read. He wished he had
a Bible that he might find it and read it again.</p>

<p>The desire grew upon him as the days went by, till
the next time he reached a city he searched out a book-store.</p>

<p>It was a little dusty book-shop in a back street, with a
kindly old gentleman in spectacles in charge, and when
Darcy asked for a Bible he looked at him over his spectacles
with a smile and asked what type of Bible he would
like. Darcy didn&#8217;t know. Did they have different types?
He had supposed a Bible was a Bible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they all alike?&#8221; he said with a troubled frown.
&#8220;I want one that has a story of a man that was born blind
and was healed. Would that be in them all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, oh, yes,&#8221; said the man happily, trotting away
and returning with an armful of Bibles. &#8220;I&#8217;ll find it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
for you. There&#8217;s a concordance in the back of this one.
This is a very good Bible&mdash;Scofield Bible, you know. Has
notes and explanations. Good binding too, though it is
a little expensive. Let&#8217;s see, let&#8217;s see, blind man, blind man&mdash;<i>born</i>
blind&mdash;yes, here it is, one of the Gospels. I thought
so. John nine, sir&mdash;&#8221; and he handed over the open page
to Darcy.</p>

<p>Standing in the little dusty book-shop, with the daylight
fading and the street lights beginning to blink out here
and there, the young man read the old story over again
until he came to the last words of the chapter: &#8220;If ye
were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see;
therefore your sin remaineth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a spear it thrust conviction to his soul. Yes, he
had not been blind. He had been proud of his ability to
see, to be a law unto himself&mdash;and he had sinned against
all that was best in himself.</p>

<p>He bought the book and went out into the dusk, pondering.
He went to a hotel and read the story over again
and turned the pages aimlessly to find more about it, but
in his soul there grew that knowledge of himself that
brought a sense of sin. So far it was only sin in the
eyes of the girl who stood to him for all that was pure
and holy in the world, but it was sin, and the weight of
the knowledge of it lay like a burden upon him. His
smile grew grave whenever it appeared, and his eyes took
on their sad wistfulness. People looked after him sometimes
and thought how strangely sad he looked for a
young man as fine and strong as he seemed to be.</p>

<p>The next time he entered a church in his search the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
preacher was reading the Bible, and the words he read
caught Darcy&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>They seemed to be stranger and sweeter than any
words he had ever heard. It reminded him of the place
where Jesus heard that the blind man had been cast out
and He came to find him. The words were these:</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed
upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:
therefore, the world knoweth us not because it knew him
not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when
he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see
him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him
purifieth himself, even as he is pure.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far he had been listening with deep interest. It
seemed like what would have been written for Mary
Massey and her niece. They were pure. They lived their
lives according to what would please God. That was
the dominating principle of their existence. He listened
wistfully. They were so far removed from his world.
He had never counted himself in with them, never expected
to be nearer to them, except that one bright day in
his childhood; but they had always lingered like luminaries
in his sky, and always he had felt that if he had been
born into a different walk in life, among Christian people
like them, he would have belonged to them, have chosen
them for his life-long companions if they had been willing.
He had known even as a child that he did not belong with
them&mdash;known that he could not fit, and kept away. Yet
he had never been able to feel satisfied with other people;
always there had been a silent aloofness in his manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
except with little children, among whom there was no
such thing as class.</p>

<p>He had named this thing that separated them &#8220;class&#8221;
in his thoughts. Now he began to see that it was something
else. It was sin. It was right and wrong that had
separated them all these years. They were not people who
stopped at class. There were no social classes in their eyes,
else they would not have companioned with him that glorious
day so intimately. He had come to know, years
back, that education had something to do with separations,
and he had taken pains to study and read, and make himself
acquainted with the best literature, and now he no
longer felt that he would be separated from them in that
way. But this thing that was back of it all was sin&mdash;had
been sin all along. Perhaps if he had gone there, as that
woman with the dear eyes had asked, he would have
learned to know sin and not have been wise in his own
conceit. Perhaps he might even have come to be in the
same world with them.</p>

<p>But the words were going on and they struck him
sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the
law; for sin is the transgression of the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, he was a transgressor of the law. He had broken
the law of the land. That had never seemed a sin before.
It had been only a matter of getting away with it. The
sin would have been in being discovered, to his mind.
Everybody else was doing it, some doing it bunglingly,
and not getting away with it. He despised them. He
had gone into it more for the game than the money. He
had known he could do it without discovery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>But he had not gotten away with it. He had been
discovered. And by that girl! Not only that, but by the
girl he most honored in all the earth!</p>

<p>If he had been asked at the start whether he would
like to have her know what he was doing he might not
have thought much about it, but when her eyes looked into
his with their question it was to him as if the great God
had asked him: &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; It was like
the question that the Lord God called in the garden in
the cool of the evening: &#8220;Adam, where art thou?&#8221; only
Darcy did not even know that story, knew Adam only as a
hazy being of history or mythology, he could not have
told which.</p>

<p>But he knew God&#8217;s voice when he heard it, even
though it spoke through the voice of a woman&mdash;the
woman he loved.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he knew that too. He loved her. He had
loved her all along. That was why he was going after
her. She was lost and he was finding her. And somehow
it was beginning to dawn upon his soul that he would
not find her until he had found the God she loved, and set
this thing right which was wrong with himself, if there
was any such thing as setting it right in this crooked world.</p>

<p>And then, if Darcy Sherwood had not been bound to
find Joyce Radway and bring her safely home, he might
have felt that life was not any longer worth living; for
all the laws by which he had lived, and all the principles
by which he had stood, were crumbling beneath him like
the sands of the sea, and he felt himself stumbling in
the darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> this time the School Board in Silverton were
sitting in solemn conclave, deciding who should take the
vacant position in the Primary Department of the Public
School, left vacant by the sudden death of the woman
who had taught that department for the last twenty-five
years.</p>

<p>The position had been open since spring, and filled
temporarily by pupils from the Normal School, most of
whom had not proved satisfactory to some one on the
Board, although three who had made formal application
for the position were now under consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have a new name I&#8217;d like to present,&#8221; said
Mr. Powers, who had just entered late, and had not heard
the wrangling over the three names by their various advocates.
&#8220;She&#8217;s a pippin, too, and I think you&#8217;d better
take her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now, Powers, don&#8217;t get in any more names.
We&#8217;re having trouble enough as it is,&#8221; laughed a member
who was in a hurry to get home. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put these three
to a vote and be done with it. I make that as a motion&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I object,&#8221; said Mr. Powers. &#8220;This young woman
has fine recommendations. I took the trouble to look
them up. She&#8217;s teaching over in Lyman&#8217;s church at that
summer Bible School he&#8217;s so crazy about, and he says she&#8217;s
the best teacher he ever had. Gets the kids and all that!
Don&#8217;t have a bit of trouble with discipline, and has &#8217;em
right with her from the word go!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;Where does she come from?&#8221; growled one of the
men, who was trying to get his candidate voted on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she lives in the little land office down on
Bryant&#8217;s lot. Mrs. Bryant can&#8217;t get done talking about
her, how much go she has, and what she can do. She&#8217;s
bought that building and had it moved there. Has a lot
of initiative and all that, and is right there in an emergency.
It seems she saved their house from getting on
fire just by keeping her head. I say that&#8217;s the kind of
girl we want in our school.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he was speaking the new superintendent entered.</p>

<p>He had just been called to fill the vacancy caused by the
old superintendent&#8217;s being called to a city school. He was
young and good-looking and they all stood somewhat in
awe of him. He had a grave manner and seemed to know
just what he wanted. They all rose to greet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Harrington, we&#8217;ve just been trying to get
this primary teacher decided upon,&#8221; said one man.
&#8220;Powers here is holding us up by presenting a new
name. Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better just stick to the three
we&#8217;ve decided upon and tried, and pick one of them? At
least we know what they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young superintendent turned toward Powers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the person in question?&#8221; he asked, looking
straight at Powers and trying to find out whether he
thought a recommendation from him would be worth
the paper it was written upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, her name is Radway, Miss Joyce Radway,&#8221;
said Powers. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you see her, professor.
She certainly is intellectual-looking and all that. I had
the pleasure of watching her teach this morning over in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
the Roberts Avenue Church. They have some kind of
a religious summer school there to occupy the children
during vacation, and the pastor tells me she is the best
teacher they have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think a minister would be a very good
judge of what was needed in the public schools,&#8221; piped up
the advocate of one of the other applicants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this one is. He&#8217;s making that school a success,
I can tell you&mdash;has something over five hundred
kiddies there regularly every day, and crazy about the
school. He won&#8217;t have anybody there that isn&#8217;t a cracker-jack
teacher&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the attitude of the superintendent suddenly drew
the attention of the speaker. Professor Harrington was
sitting alert, all attention, interest in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say her name was Radway? Joyce Radway?
There could scarcely be two of that name, I should
think. It is rather an unusual name. If it&#8217;s the Miss
Radway I know, I should say have her by all means.
I&#8217;ve been hunting for her for the last two months, only
gave it up because I was called here. Did she come from
Meadow Brook, do you happen to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I didn&#8217;t ask about
that. But I can find out. Suppose I go and bring her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see if she is
the same one. She certainly gave promise of being a rare
mind. I had the pleasure of looking over her examination
papers&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Powers had already seized his hat and gone out
the door. There was a special reason why he wanted to
&#8220;put one over&#8221; on the men who were sponsoring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
other candidates, and he didn&#8217;t mean to lose a single chance.
He went at once to the school telephone and called up Mrs.
Bryant, asking her to ask Miss Radway to be ready to
come back with him.</p>

<p>And so it was that Joyce, summoned from her preparation
of the Bible-school lesson for the next day, hurried
into a pretty little blue voile she had just finished and
was ready when Mr. Powers arrived to go before the
School Board.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, she stood, at last, before Professor
Harrington, who had wasted many precious hours of his
time, to say nothing of telephone charges and letters, trying
to locate this special teacher, and when she finally
stood before him he looked into her clear blue eyes and
said to himself, &#8220;That&#8217;s the girl I want.&#8221; And aloud, to
the School Board, he said gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure, from what I know of Miss Radway&#8217;s
work, that she is eminently fitted to teach in our school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce lifted astonished eyes to the fine, scholarly face
and didn&#8217;t in the least recognize him. But she had sense
enough left in spite of her perturbation not to say so, and
in a few minutes she was dismissed from the room and
the vote was carried in her favor.</p>

<p>The fact was, every man of them was prepossessed in
her favor so soon as he looked into her eyes, and the three
bobbed-haired candidates hadn&#8217;t a chance, with her on
the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought she was a cook!&#8221; said one wife when
her husband got home from the School Board meeting
and told her about the election of the new teacher. &#8220;Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Powers told me she got dinner for her one night when
she had company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked Powers about that,&#8221; her husband answered.
&#8220;It seems she just did it to help them out when she first
came, while she was looking for a job. Powers said he
never tasted such cooking. His wife offered her twenty-five
dollars just to stay and cook dinner on Sunday for
some guests and she wouldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame her. Mrs. Powers is very unpleasant
to get along with, all the maids say. But it does
seem strange to hire a cook to teach in the school. I
think we&#8217;ll send Genevieve to a private school this fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t send Genevieve to any private school,
not if I have anything to say about it, and I guess I&#8217;d
have to pay the bills. Not while I&#8217;m on the School Board
either. How do you think that would make me look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could resign. You could say you didn&#8217;t approve
of having cooks teach our children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do approve. It&#8217;s a pity Genevieve couldn&#8217;t
learn to cook too. I&#8217;ve seen this girl and I want my
children under her. I count it a privilege to have them
under her. I like her looks. She doesn&#8217;t paint her face,
nor bob her hair, nor wear clothes way up to her knees.
And she doesn&#8217;t wear dangle-dangles in her ears, nor
pull out her eyebrows. She wears neat, sensible, pretty
things and looks like a good girl, and that&#8217;s the kind we
want our little children under. That Miss Harlow you
wanted me to vote for makes eyes at every man that comes
near her, married or single. This girl tends to her business
and knows what she&#8217;s about. I voted for her, and
I mean to stick by her. Now! I want it understood that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
she is <i>not a cook</i>. She may know <i>how</i> to cook, but that
talk about her being a cook doesn&#8217;t go another step from
this house! Understand? If it does, there&#8217;s going to
be a big overhauling somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, if you&#8217;ve taken her up,&#8221; said his wife
disagreeably. &#8220;It seems she has all the men on her side
even if she doesn&#8217;t make eyes at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t need to. She&#8217;s a good girl and she
doesn&#8217;t want &#8217;em; and that&#8217;s the kind the children ought
to have.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Joyce was established in the Primary Department
of the Silverton School, under the very immediate supervision
of the new superintendent, who paid her marked
attention from the first, to her evident embarrassment.</p>

<p>Joyce was not averse to having friends, nor to going
out and having good times like other girls, but it happened
that the very first thing this luckless young man asked
her to was a dance, and she had to tell him she didn&#8217;t dance.</p>

<p>Joyce didn&#8217;t like to go around flaunting her principles,
and never talked about those things unless she had to, but
he argued the question with her. He certainly wanted
to take her to that dance. But when it came to arguing,
Joyce just smiled and said she was sorry to seem ungracious,
but she didn&#8217;t care to learn to dance. Well, would
she go to an orchestra concert in the city with him then?
Yes, she said she would enjoy that. So they went. But
he, poor soul, felt himself called upon to bring Joyce
into a better way of thinking about the dancing, &#8220;a more
modern view,&#8221; he called it, and they certainly did not get
on very well.</p>

<p>Then he told her how he had hunted for her in Meadow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Brook, and how he had admired her from seeing her
just once; how she was different from other girls, that
was what he admired about her; and Joyce looked up with
a smile and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why are you trying to make me over just like
all the rest?&#8221; He looked at her a moment embarrassedly,
and then began to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said after a moment. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I
do want to. I like you just as you are.&#8221; After that they
talked about books, and summer, and the beautiful meadows
about Meadow Brook, and they seemed quite good
friends. He asked her why she ran away, and she said
evasively, that it was hard for her to stay where she and
her aunt had been happy so many years, and she felt it
would be better for everybody if she went, and went
quietly, without waiting to bid all her dear friends good-bye.
She saw he had not been intimate with any of her
intimate friends, and rightly surmised that he had not
heard anything peculiar about her going.</p>

<p>It did occur to her that he might write back sometime
and speak about her to some one, but it seemed rather
unlikely; and she was going to write home pretty soon
anyway, so she thought no more of the matter.</p>

<p>A very pleasant friendship sprang up between Joyce
and John Harrington. Not that there was anything sentimental
about it, as yet. John Harrington might express
his admiration of a girl, but that was all until he
was quite sure of himself; also quite sure of her. It was
one thing to run after a new teacher with all his heart.
It was quite another thing to commit himself personally.
Harrington was a most judicious young man. He would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
not have been called to take charge of the Silverton School
if he had not been. He was well satisfied in his mind
as to his own feelings toward Joyce, but it was not yet
time to commit himself. Joyce needed molding and modifying.
She needed modernizing somewhat before she
would be fitted to become the wife of a superintendent.
So he set himself to mold and modernize her.</p>

<p>Joyce was simple-hearted and happy. She loved her
work, and she was having a good time. The superintendent
did not pick her out to focus his entire attention
upon her and make her an object of jealousy, therefore
she enjoyed the occasional trips to the city to hear some
fine music, and the constantly kindly helpfulness of the
young man as her head in the school. Things were going
well with her, and she thanked God every night.</p>

<p>Somehow, however, with Harrington&#8217;s advent there
had come so many new things that her time was more than
filled. The letters she had planned to write to Meadow
Brook were still unwritten, and the more she thought
about them (usually at night, after she had got to bed,
and was reviewing the day), the harder they seemed to
write. How to explain her going, what to say about Nan
and Gene. It would be so disagreeable if Nan should take
it into her head to come after her and coax her to come
back and live with them. Nan hated housework, and she
could not help knowing that she was valuable to her
in that way. No, she was not yet ready to write home.</p>

<p>So the days drifted by, full of hard work, and pleasantness.
She loved her young pupils and they loved her.
Often they invited her to their homes, and here she met
many pleasant people who showed themselves as more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
friendly. She could have spent every evening in a merry
round if she had chosen. But, here again, the fact that
she was a very old-fashioned girl, and neither danced nor
played bridge nor mah jong, nor could be persuaded to
learn, set her apart, and saved many evenings for reading
and study and necessary sewing. People tried to persuade
her at first, laughed at her, and cajoled her, but she remained
sweetly firm, yet without preaching to them, and
they finally, good-naturedly, let her alone.</p>

<p>Sometimes she had little gatherings of two or three
people in her wee house, and served them chocolate and
delectable little cakes, or Welsh rarebit or hot pancakes
made on her little electric grill. Harrington was occasionally
included in these gatherings, but she never received
young men alone. She told them they could not come
without some woman friend with them. They laughed at
her old-fashioned ideas, but they went away and found
some quiet elderly friend and came again. Joyce&#8217;s home
began to have a reputation all its own, showing a girl
could live alone and yet keep free from all the unconventions
of the modern world. If any one grew troublesome
there was always Mrs. Bryant to whom she might call,
and Mrs. Bryant understood and always happened in
whenever she knew Joyce had a caller who might want
to stay alone.</p>

<p>So the fall passed and the winter entered in.</p>

<p>Jim had finished the chimney and fireplace, and the
little room was warm and cosy, even on a bitter November
evening with the wind howling outside.</p>

<p>It had not taken Harrington long to find out which
was the most influential and intellectual church in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
community and to connect himself with it. Thereafter,
he set about bringing Joyce to go with him sometimes.
He felt if she could but listen to the wise and modern
thoughts of this most learned divine, who preached at
his chosen church, it would be easier to win her from
some of her narrow views. But when he asked her to go
to church with him, one evening, she told him she could
not leave her own, that she had asked her Sunday School
class to go with her that night. When he said, then they
would go the next Sunday night, she looked at him with
her clear eyes and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have to say no again, but I cannot go
to that church at all. That minister dishonors my Lord,
and I do not feel I can ever listen to him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told her it sounded pharisaical for a young girl like
herself to set up to criticise a man of the minister&#8217;s years
and standing. Didn&#8217;t she know that the great denomination
for which he stood was back of him, and that they
knew better than she did, a young girl with little experience?
Besides, what about that Bible verse that said you
mustn&#8217;t speak evil of dignitaries? She had been taught
by dear old-fashioned people, and it was beautiful to look
back on such an upbringing, but, of course, it wasn&#8217;t
progress to stay just where her forefathers had stood.
She ought to go on to higher realms of thought. It
wasn&#8217;t Christian to stand still. Things were not as they
used to be. Science and art and everything else had
progressed and grown, why should not religion? Men
had learned more of God, and grown wiser. They had
learned that He was not the same God their fathers had
supposed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>Her answer was to look at him steadily with rising
color, and repeat:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.&#8217;
And I&#8217;m not speaking evil of dignitaries. I&#8217;m telling
you he dishonored my Lord. The Bible says, &#8216;From
such turn away.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now, don&#8217;t you think you are pressing a point
too far?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of course Christ is the same, it&#8217;s
our views of Him that have changed. We have grown,
and are able to see Him in a bigger, broader sense, as a
grand example for the whole world; not just a little personal
God who attends to each detail of our life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I wouldn&#8217;t care much about Him if He
wasn&#8217;t personal, and didn&#8217;t care for the details of my life,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I take great pleasure in that verse: &#8216;He
knoweth the way that I take,&#8217; and &#8216;The very hairs of
your head are all numbered,&#8217; and &#8216;Fear ye not, therefore,
ye are of more value than many sparrows.&#8217; And my God
isn&#8217;t a little one, either, because He attends to all the details.
He wouldn&#8217;t be a God at all if He didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly wish I had your memory,&#8221; said the young
man with a look of admiration. &#8220;You have a fine mind.
You would have made a good lawyer. But I hate to see
you so narrow. It isn&#8217;t like you in other things to
be narrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enter ye in at the strait gate,&#8221; began Joyce
thoughtfully. &#8220;For wide is the gate and broad is the way
that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in
thereat; because strait is the gate and narrow is the way
that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you are actually priding yourself on being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
narrow!&#8221; He spoke almost angrily. It was annoying to
have her so stubborn, so ignorant of modern ideas, so
bound by these old traditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said sadly. &#8220;Those are not my words.
They are my Lord&#8217;s. I didn&#8217;t make them. I&#8217;m only telling
you why I&#8217;m narrow, as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;d only go to a respectable church, and
hear some really good teaching along intellectual lines I
feel sure you are bright enough and open-minded enough
to give up these silly, pharisaical ideas. They are really
too egotistical for a sweet young girl like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce lifted her eyes sadly to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand because you can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Your eyes are blinded. There are a great many people
like that nowadays. I didn&#8217;t know it till I came away from
Meadow Brook. I didn&#8217;t understand what the verse meant
when it said that the natural man could not understand
the things of the Spirit. Now I know. You can&#8217;t understand
because you haven&#8217;t been born again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I dislike that phrase. Please don&#8217;t use it. It&#8217;s
so ridiculous to talk that way in this age of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus Christ used it,&#8221; said Joyce quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t a thing to be talked about,&#8221; he said
crossly. &#8220;How should you set up to say I&#8217;m not &#8216;born
again&#8217; as you say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you don&#8217;t understand. Because you can
listen to a minister who doesn&#8217;t believe that Jesus died
to shed His blood to wash away our sins. Because you
can listen to a man who can dare to say that they called
Jesus divine because they couldn&#8217;t think of any other word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
to use, and who said the blind man only thought he was
blind, and Jesus just waked him up to open his eyes and
use them. I heard him say all those things, and I can&#8217;t
go and listen to him any more. It is dishonoring my Lord
to hear him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think the person that brought you up was
awfully to blame,&#8221; he said with contempt in his voice.
&#8220;To saddle anybody with as many hidebound doctrines
as you seem to have is a sin. Whoever it was will have
to answer for it some day. You have an unusually fine
mind, and if you would once give up these foolish legends
and prejudices with which your mind is filled you would
be a brilliant woman with a great future before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce stood up and looked at him gravely, her eyes
brilliant, her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not be a brilliant woman,&#8221; she said sweetly,
&#8220;but I certainly have a great future before me. I&#8217;m going
to live and reign with Jesus Christ some day, and I don&#8217;t
really think it matters so very much whether I&#8217;m brilliant
down here or not with that in view. But you&#8217;ll have to excuse
me from any further talk on this subject. You have
cast a slur on my faith and we really haven&#8217;t anything in
common when you do that. I <i>know</i> my Christ, and you
don&#8217;t seem to. I must go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She swept out of his office, whither he had summoned
her on pretext of consulting her about some of her scholars
who were to be promoted. There was something so
final about her going that it quite depressed him, and
after a night&#8217;s wakefulness he went to see her, and had
the good grace to apologize to her, and to say he would
like her to try and show him what she meant by her faith.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;If you will come to the church where I go you will
find out much better than I can teach you,&#8221; she said, for
she did not more than half believe that he wanted to know.</p>

<p>So he agreed to go with her the following Sunday
evening, and she began to mention his name in her prayers
as she knelt in the moonlight in her little room. &#8220;Dear
Father, show me how to make him understand,&#8221; she
prayed. But always her prayer ended with: &#8220;Find Darcy
please, and don&#8217;t let him lose the way home, for
Christ&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Matters</span> had come to such a pass in the Massey home
that Eugene and his wife scarcely had a pleasant word
to say to one another, and Nan spent much time in weeping.</p>

<p>She had ransacked the house to find some papers of
her mother-in-law&#8217;s that would prove that the house was
theirs, but had found nothing. On the contrary, there
were letters and papers that showed that both Gene&#8217;s
mother and his aunt had always known that the house
belonged to Joyce. There were also references to &#8220;money&#8221;
and Nan began to fear that Gene and she would have
nothing. Gene&#8217;s business wasn&#8217;t very good, and it had
been growing worse of late, because he was so distracted
by this matter of the will that he scarcely gave any attention
at all to it; and Nan was running up terrible bills
which she dared not tell him about, hoping every day that
Joyce would turn up and matters would straighten out.
But Joyce did not return, and every day the bills grew.</p>

<p>At first, when she found them, Nan considered burning
these letters that said so much about the property, but
after reading them carefully over again, she was afraid
to do so, lest somehow that would be only making a
bad matter worse. What if Joyce knew of these letters
and should return some day and demand them? So she
purchased a strong metal box, locked them therein and
hid them among her own private possessions. If they
were ever demanded she could say she had put them away
for safe-keeping. If they were not, and it came out that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the house was theirs after all, she could easily burn them
sometime.</p>

<p>But things were going from bad to worse, and after
two of the tradesmen whom she owed had visited her,
demanding their money when she had none to give them,
she decided that something radical must be done.</p>

<p>So she dressed herself in deep mourning one day and
went to call on the minister.</p>

<p>There were dark circles under her eyes and a sad
droop to her lips. She carried a black-bordered handkerchief
and asked to see Doctor Ballantine privately.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballantine took her into the study, and Nan addressed
herself to him with instant tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Doctor Ballantine,&#8221; she said, stanching the flood
with her handkerchief and sinking into the offered chair,
&#8220;I&#8217;m so miserable and unhappy! I simply had to come and
see you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Ballantine put up his pen, and slipped a blotter
over the sermon he was just finishing for the morrow,
and expressed himself sympathetically, wondering anxiously
what had happened. Had this woman come to
tell him of some great tragedy or to confess her sins?
Alarm filled his heart, and instant premonitions of danger
to Joyce. Somehow Nan was not the kind of woman
that one would ever think of in connection with any religious
convictions. It never even entered the good man&#8217;s
heart that she had come to inquire about her soul. Afterwards
he thought of this with some wonder and self-reproach.</p>

<p>But Nan recovered from her brief emotion and began
to talk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s about my husband&#8217;s cousin, Joyce Radway,&#8221; she
stated, and the good doctor was instant attention. &#8220;You
see, we haven&#8217;t heard from her since she went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said Doctor Ballantine with startled
tone. &#8220;Where is she? Perhaps you would like to have
me write, or telegraph to the minister there to learn of
her safety. Are you afraid she is ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t know&mdash;&#8221; wailed Nan, breaking down
again. &#8220;We don&#8217;t even know where she is. She hasn&#8217;t
told us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know? She hasn&#8217;t told you? Why,&#8221; said
the minister, half rising from his seat, &#8220;that&#8217;s not at
all like Joyce to leave you in anxiety. Didn&#8217;t she tell you
where she was going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; sobbed Nan. &#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t tell us. She
just walked out of the house without saying a word, and
never came back. We thought of course she would come
back pretty soon. She always did before when she got
upset or angry&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upset? Angry?&#8221; said the puzzled minister. &#8220;What,
may I ask, what do you think she was angry at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing at all, just a little thing. You know
Joyce has a fearful temper. Or perhaps you don&#8217;t know
it. Those quiet, mild people never do show up what
they are till you come to live with them. Of course I
don&#8217;t blame poor Joyce. She had to be on such a strain
all the time poor mother was ill. She wouldn&#8217;t let a person
but Joyce come near her, and it was almost more than
the girl could bear. I sometimes used to be afraid she
would go out of her mind before the end came, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
were so many demands made upon her. And a young girl
like that wants to have a good time, you know&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound like Joyce&mdash;&#8221; The minister spoke
gravely. &#8220;She was devoted to Mrs. Massey. You
haven&#8217;t known her as long as I have. She was only a
tiny child when I came here, you know, and Mother and
I&mdash;we loved her. She was like our little one that was
taken away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, she was attractive,&#8221; Nan hastened to
say, mopping her eyes daintily. &#8220;And she liked to pose as
a dutiful daughter. Still, you know, Doctor Ballantine,
a girl likes a good time. I knew you thought a good deal
of her and were interested in her welfare and all, and that&#8217;s
why I came to you. I haven&#8217;t told my husband I was coming.
I don&#8217;t know what he would say if he knew. He&#8217;s
very proud and independent, and he feels this thing keenly.
But I just thought I would come to you to see if you
couldn&#8217;t help find Joyce. You know her friends and know
her so well. I thought you might know some place to look
for her that hasn&#8217;t occurred to us. We have been here so
short a time. But you mustn&#8217;t tell my husband. You
must promise me that before we begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never a good thing for a woman to hide a thing
from her husband,&#8221; said the minister, still gravely. &#8220;Mrs.
Massey, my advice to you is to go home and tell your
husband you have spoken to me before you tell me anything
more about it. Then if he wishes me to be in your
confidence further we can go on from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Doctor Ballantine!&#8221; broke out Nan afresh with
frightened tears. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t possibly do that. You
see he is so sensitive about it because it was his words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
that made Joyce angry. He told her, very kindly&mdash;he
always speaks gently in his family&mdash;and I was right in
the room when he did it. I heard every word. There
wasn&#8217;t the least reason in the world for her to get angry,
only she was just in the mood for it. She&#8217;s very temperamental,
you know. He asked her to please not let her
electric light burn all night, that the bill had just come
in and was pretty large, and we must all try to remember
and turn the lights out whenever they were not needed.
Now you know there wasn&#8217;t anything in that to make a girl
get furious and stamp her foot and fling herself out of
the kitchen in a pet. I was just putting on dinner when
she went, and I thought of course she would come back
pretty soon. She always did before. But this time
she didn&#8217;t. I suppose she must have been waiting for
us to come out and coax her back, but we thought it wisest
for her not to run after her, for we had noticed ever since
Mother&#8217;s death that she showed a tendency to get into a
huff and stay there, and we thought if we just went quietly
about and ignored her temper she would come out of it
sooner. That&#8217;s the way we always do with the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for encouragement, but the Doctor, with
set lips and stern eyes, was watching her, saying nothing.
Nan began to catch her breath again in a trembling sob,
and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;When it began to get dark I got worried and told
Gene he simply must go out to the barn and bring her in.
It was too damp and chilly for her to stay out there after
dark. That was where she always went when she got
in a pet, and we expected, of course, to find her in her
usual place. But when Gene went out with his flashlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
there wasn&#8217;t a trace of her anywhere, and he came back
all upset.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused to observe the impression she was making,
but the minister&#8217;s face wore a mask of dignity and she
hurried on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t tell you these things, of course, for it is
terrible to me to reveal the little weaknesses of my husband&#8217;s
family, but I must tell some one and get some
help, for I am nearly crazy. I sometimes think my husband
will lose his mind. He is naturally very fond of
Joyce, for she was brought up like his own sister, you
know, and he is almost breaking under the anxiety&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister said nothing to help her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have searched the world over, every place we
can think of, and no trace whatever of her. It is almost
like the case of Charlie Ross, and now Gene can&#8217;t sleep
at night, he is so anxious&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want my husband to get the detectives at work
after her, but he keeps hoping we shall hear. He simply
can&#8217;t bear the publicity of it all, and for my sake especially.
So I decided this afternoon to just come and confide in
you. You&#8217;re so wise and kind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister arose with that compelling look that
makes a caller arise also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Massey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wish there were some
comfort I could give you. I will think this matter over,
and will talk it over with my wife. I never keep anything
from my wife, but be assured it will go no further. Meantime,
I advise you to go home and tell your husband what
you have done. There is nothing to be gained by keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
it from him, and I most certainly cannot enter into any
plan whatever to help without his full knowledge and sanction.
Meantime, of course, Mrs. Ballantine and I will consult,
and if there is any one that we think might help in
this matter we will let you and Mr. Massey know. I
don&#8217;t mind telling you that we have been anxious about
our young friend even before you came. It seemed so
utterly unlike Joyce to go off in that way without a word
to us. She&mdash;is not like that. There must have been&mdash;some
reason&mdash;something more than you have stated&mdash;perhaps
more than you understood&mdash;perhaps some misunderstanding
on her part. Really, Mrs. Massey, Joyce <i>is not</i>
like that. I have known her a long time&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say, Doctor Ballantine. That&#8217;s what
I&#8217;m afraid of. I&#8217;m just afraid to mention it to my husband,
it would be so perfectly terrible to him to think of such
a thing in connection with his family, but sometimes&mdash;sometimes&mdash;I&#8217;ve
really been afraid&mdash;now, of course, I
wouldn&#8217;t want you to mention this even to Mrs. Ballantine&mdash;unless
you simply have to&mdash;but sometimes I&#8217;ve been
afraid that Joyce was&mdash;losing her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I know you&#8217;re shocked, but I simply <i>had</i> to
tell you, and I thought if you could just kind of quietly
inquire around among the insane asylums in this neighborhood,
and see if any young person has been brought
in like that&mdash;You, being a minister, can get entrance into
these places&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Massey!&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister&#8217;s voice was stern. Nan hardly knew him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Massey, nothing like that has happened! Joyce
Radway has never lost her mind! She is too filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
the spirit of Christ for that. She is too much God&#8217;s
child. There is nothing like Jesus Christ to keep a mind
sane and steady. Don&#8217;t ever utter that thought to any
living being again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan cringed as she stood by the study door. His
voice was almost like the command of one who had authority
over her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you <i>sure</i>?&#8221; she managed to say weepily.
&#8220;That&#8217;s such a comfort. That thought has tormented
me night and day, perhaps Joyce was shut up in some
awful insane asylum&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said the doctor sternly. &#8220;That could never
be. She may have fallen into some danger, or be
sick in some hospital, but never that! She is God&#8217;s
own child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan slid out of the door like a serpent, rebuked, murmuring:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad I came, you&#8217;ve given me so much comfort!&#8221;
but she walked down the street with angry eyes
and set mouth. Her mission had been a failure so far as
winning over that old dolt was concerned. What a fool
he was over Joyce! What a fool everybody was over her!
What did they see in her anyway to be so crazy about?
She couldn&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as she drew toward her own home, meditating
on her recent interview, something in her heart
told her exultantly that she had not failed entirely, for
she had managed to give a different coloring to the situation,
much as the old minister had hated to accept it. He
would think it over, and he would presently come to be
uncertain, and perhaps to half believe what she had told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
him. And when later, other developments occurred, he
might give credence to the thoughts which she had put
into his mind. Nan was not extremely clever, but, somehow,
the devil in her shallow heart comforted her with
this, and the hope that some day, if trouble really broke,
Gene would thank her and be proud of her for having
prepared the way for a creditable story that would not
reflect upon them.</p>

<p>By the time she had got supper ready she was quite
pleased with her afternoon&#8217;s work. She had planted the
seed in Doctor Ballantine&#8217;s subconscious mind and it would
grow. By the time he told his wife it would even so soon
have begun to grow. She need not worry about developments.
Perhaps even Gene would never have to know
that she had had anything to do with it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">So far</span> Lib Knox had resisted all attempts to be
friendly with Tyke. He had tried candy, a little white
kitten, and a fox terrier poodle, but Lib only turned a
cold shoulder.</p>

<p>Even the day when he arrived in a motor cycle with a
side-car and offered her a ride he almost failed, although
he could see that it went hard with her to refuse. It
was when at last he told her that she was afraid, and
dared her to come with him for a five-mile spin, that she
finally yielded. Lib never could take a dare.</p>

<p>Seated in the chariot, she surveyed her comrades with
superior arrogance and enjoyed to the full her triumphal
departure from the district where she lived. But
once out on the highway, Tyke let out all the power
and shot through space as if he had suddenly taken leave
of his senses. Lib gripped the sides of her car and sat
erect, her eyes bulging, her white lips set in a frightened
smile. She was badly scared, but she was game.</p>

<p>For several miles he tore away at this mad pace, seeming
to graze telegraph poles, almost telescope automobiles,
and just escaped killing men and dogs. Then he slowed
down and turned into a side road where there was comparatively
little traffic, a cross-road leading to another
highway.</p>

<p>Lib, breathless, still gripped the car, obviously speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, kid,&#8221; said her captor, bending toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
her insinuatingly, &#8220;you thought that was fast,
didn&#8217;t you? But that ain&#8217;t a continental to what I kin
do with this here brig. Why, I kin go so fast it&#8217;ll take
the hair right off&#8217;n yer head and leave yer bald like a old
man. It&#8217;ll take yer breath outen ya, so&#8217;t&#8217;ya can&#8217;t speak
right fer a week, an&#8217; it&#8217;ll maybe sweep ya right out in
the field and leave ya fer the crows ta pick. An&#8217; that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;m agonta do&#8217;ith ya kid, ef ya don&#8217;t tell me where
that doggone uncle of yourn is hanging up. See? I&#8217;m
givin&#8217; ya time till I get ta that there highway out there
t&#8217;consider. Ef ya don&#8217;t come across with what I want
y&#8217;ll be slung like a arrow through the air, an&#8217; ya won&#8217;t
know yerself. Y&#8217;ll wonder where&#8217;s yer daddy an&#8217; yer ma,
and yell like a little baby, but it won&#8217;t do no good, fer nobody
can&#8217;t hear ya when yer goin&#8217; like a wild cat. Now,
what say? Are ye givin&#8217; me the necessary information, ur
shall I let &#8217;er go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lib was gripping the sides of her car with small, wiry
fingers that were white and tense. Her little freckled face
was white beneath its tan, and the bronze-gold of her
bobbed curls ruffled above eyes that were wide with fear.
She swallowed to get her voice, and suddenly her sharp
little lips trembled into an impish grin and she trembled
out tauntingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;G-g-go ahead! I-l-l-like it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil you do!&#8221; roared Tyke angrily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give
ye enough then, you little runt you,&#8221; and they shot into
the highway into the midst of the worst traffic they had
yet seen. Tyke was so angry he could scarcely see where
he went, and he let out the power till they seemed to be
but a streak in the air as they flew along to what seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
like destruction. It seemed to little Lib of the fiery heart
that she was aging as she went, that if she ever stopped
she would be old and tottering, that her hands were numb
and her face stung with the wind, and she was cold to her
soul through the thin little clothing she wore. But she
gave no sign, as the car went on and on, and miles of trees
and meadows and houses and towns shot by in the flash
of an eye. Lib wondered if it would go on forever. And
then, just as she thought she could not hold on another
minute, as she wished she might drop from the back and
be crushed into insensibility by the fall, and never come
to life again any more, because her heart hurt so in her
breast, and her eyes were going to cry (which to Lib was
the worst thing that could ever happen to her, that she
should be weak enough to cry)&mdash;just then, when things
could not have gone on any longer and she exist, they came
to a road leading into the woods and the motor cycle
slowed down and bumped into the rough road and up a
hill into dense woods, suddenly coming to a standstill.</p>

<p>Tyke turned upon her with an evil look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little devil, you!&#8221; he said, glaring at her with
the glare of one who had been baffled.</p>

<p>Lib was too frightened to speak, and her teeth were
chattering with the cold, but she lifted her game little face
toward his evil one and suddenly stuck out her tongue and
made an impish face at him, expressing all the hate and
loathing of her little courageous soul. The man looked
down at her astonished, blinking, scarcely believing that
such daring could come from a baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;I c&#8217;d kill you, you young &#8217;un&mdash;&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what good that would do,&#8221; said Lib unexpectedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
her quick mind intrigued by the situation.
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t find out where my uncle lived by killing
me, could you? It isn&#8217;t written inside my head anywhere,&#8221;
and she laughed a ghoulish little laugh made all
the more weird by the tremble of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lib was gathering strength with her breath as
it returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never said I wouldn&#8217;t tell you where my uncle was,
did I?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was speechless. Could it be that this mere
infant was kidding him? Not scared at all, but just putting
one over on him? He stared at her in bewilderment. Lib,
eying him, knew that she had gained a point. She summoned
voice again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t going to tell you till I get back home
again. If you had asked me polite like a gentleman when
you first took me, I might uv; but now I shan&#8217;t tell ya a
thing till I&#8217;m back home. Come on, get a move on. I&#8217;ve
gotta get back and study my spelling fer tomorrow. Can&#8217;t
you get through this road or do ya have to turn around?&#8221;</p>

<p>The nonchalance of her! Tyke couldn&#8217;t help but admire
it while yet his anger smouldered. It was for all the
world like her cool, collected uncle, white and calm under
fire. He was amazed, but somehow, he was conquered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You swear you give it to me straight &#8217;f I take you
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t swear,&#8221; said Lib coolly. &#8220;It&#8217;s naughty. My
mother doesn&#8217;t like me to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyke grew black and swore under his breath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; no nonsense!&#8221; he lowered. &#8220;You
gimme that address ur I&#8217;ll kill ya yet, I swear I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lib was getting her second wind. She eyed him
furtively. She was not nearly so frightened now. She
was trying to think what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s up in Canada somewhere,&#8221; she said, &#8220;a
name that begins with a Q. If you&#8217;d start the car home
I could mebbe think. Quebec. That&#8217;s it. I never can remember
that name. But I can&#8217;t think of the street until
we get back home. There&#8217;s a street there by the same name.
You run back and I&#8217;ll show you where to find it. It&#8217;s 737
that street. Now, will you take me back?&#8221;</p>

<p>The motor began to rumble again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tellin&#8217; me straight, you little devil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Lib, settling back and trying to still her
teeth from chattering and her weak little knees from
trembling, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go fast again like we did. I&#8217;m getting
hungry, and my mother won&#8217;t like you if you keep me
away so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyke glared at her, but he put on his goggles and
started toward home. When they reached the edge of the
town Lib sat up straight and directed his movements.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go up that street and down the first turn to the
right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No, it was the next street I meant, I
guess.&#8221; She studied the street-markers thoughtfully, the
while she made him go past the houses of her most intimate
friends, and enemies, casually greeting them as she
passed by in this her triumphal procession through her
own domain.</p>

<p>And so when she had traversed them all, the streets
of those she wished to impress, she exclaimed, &#8220;Oh, yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
there &#8217;tis! State Street. That&#8217;s it. 737 State Street.
Now, you c&#8217;n let me out here if you please. My mother
don&#8217;t like me to be out with strangers and she mightn&#8217;t
be nice to you.&#8221; And Tyke wisely let her out and went on
his way wondering, saying over to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a little devil, but she&#8217;s a tough one. She&#8217;s
a tough little nut, that&#8217;s what she is. I wonder now if
she&#8217;s makin&#8217; a monkey out o&#8217; me! Guess I&#8217;ll get some gas
and take a try at Canada. Better to tend to such business
myself. &#8217;Taint safe to trust ta ennybody these days.
Wonder now ef I could get a warrant. Guess not, seein&#8217;
it&#8217;s Canada. He&#8217;s a sharper all right. He lit out to a
safe place all right with his dame. Guess I&#8217;ll have to go
up. No other way. Have to put one over on him somehow
and get him back where we can do something under
the law of the United States.&#8221; He swelled himself
proudly at that as if he himself were a worthy citizen.
Then he went to one of his haunts to prepare for the
journey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In her little nightgown beside her bed little Lib Knox
knelt down for perhaps the first time in her life to pray.
She had not wanted her supper though there were griddle-cakes,
and Lib dearly loved griddle-cakes. But she had
something on her mind, and her primitive soul took the
old, old way to the only Power she knew for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God,&#8221; she prayed, &#8220;that&#8217;s a bad man after my
uncle, please, and I don&#8217;t know where he is. Won&#8217;t you
just please take care of him? I don&#8217;t know what he
wants, but Uncle Darcy ought to be told he&#8217;s coming,
and I don&#8217;t know how to do it. Won&#8217;t you please try.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
I s&#8217;pose you can see in the dark and know where he is,
and if you&#8217;ll just please hide him when that man comes
I&#8217;ll be glad, and I&#8217;ll try to do something for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She half rose in the darkness, shivering in her little
thin gown that was too short for her growing length.
Then she slid down on one knee again and spoke in
a whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;And say, God, you knew that was a lie I told, didn&#8217;t
you? That about Quebec? I just got it outta my geography
lesson we had today, you know. I thought I oughtta
tell you, seeing you&#8217;re going to help. You won&#8217;t mind
a lie for once, will you? You see I had to or he mightta
killed me. You wouldn&#8217;t a wanted me killed, would you,
God? Or else why did you make me? Besides, what
would mother &#8217;uv done? So please won&#8217;t you kill that
naughty man if you can. If not, keep him away from me
anyway. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having paused a moment with a crown of moonlight
on her little rebel curls, she crept into bed and was
soon asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning Lib awoke very early, and, procuring
a paper and pencil from her geography, which she
had placed under her bed the night before, she wrote in
crooked little handwriting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Dere Unkle Darcie:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ther is a bad man cums hear to find out whar yo
ar. He tuk me a rid on a motrsikle. I didunt lik it but I
didunt let hym no. He thretend to kyl me if I didunt give
hym yor adres, so I maid upp one and he brot me hom.
I wisht that yoo wud cum home so I cud tak ker of yoo.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
It is offul hard takan ker when I dont no wher yoo ar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wisht yoo wer hear. It is lonesum. From Lib.
P.S. I was skard, but he didunt no it.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Lib had found an envelope in the table downstairs,
and she sealed her letter and took it to her father to
address, but her father shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Lib. Uncle Darcy didn&#8217;t leave his
address. He&#8217;s travelling, I reckon. But we&#8217;ll send it
where he goes sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the letter started on its warning way to Darcy.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter had come on, introduced by a long and
brilliant autumn, and Joyce was so engrossed in her work
that she scarcely realized how long it was since she had
left Meadow Brook.</p>

<p>In addition to her work she had become deeply engrossed
in Bible study.</p>

<p>In one of her trips to the city she had discovered a
Bible School of national renown, and found that she
could so arrange her schedule as to make one or two
evening classes a week possible. Thereafter when she
was not actually busy with her school work, or doing some
little helpful thing for somebody else, she could be found
studying her Bible. It had become a fascination, this
searching for new riches in the Book. She had always
enjoyed studying it, but never before with such a hunger
for it as came now. Day by day gave her new wonders,
a new opening up of the revelation of God to His children.</p>

<p>When Professor Harrington asked her to go somewhere
with him he frequently found that she had another
engagement in the city. Becoming curious, she finally
took him to one of her classes, with the result that he entered
into a lengthy argument with her all the way home,
trying to persuade her to give it up. He informed her that
it was ridiculous for her to waste her fine mind being led
by men who ignored the simplest principles of science, and
pinned their faith to a book that was so old that no one
could be sure who wrote it, or where it came from. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
told her that a person was a fool to swallow whole the
teachings of men who denied geology, zo&ouml;logy, science
in every branch; who taught that the legends of Scripture
were actual truths; and who dared to enter into the
occult and profess to have spiritual relations with the
Maker of the Universe; who even descended to the ridiculous
and marked out the future from the mystical writings
of the men they chose to call prophets.</p>

<p>When he reached this point Joyce sat up straight in
the train, her cheeks glowing, her eyes bright, so that
those sitting near must have noticed her, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! I cannot listen to any more of your talk.
You and I simply have nothing in common&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that he had offended her, and sought to make
his peace. He apologized and said they would speak of
something else, and for the remainder of the half-hour
that the late train took in dragging from station to station
till it reached Silverton, he made himself most fascinating,
telling in his best style of a trip he took to Switzerland the
summer before.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Joyce would have enjoyed this with all
her eager young mind, visualizing the beautiful descriptions
and putting herself there almost as if she had experienced
it herself. But now she only sat quietly, looking
straight ahead, a withdrawal in her manner, a look in
her eyes as if she saw something that others could not see;
an air that showed she was thinking deeply about something,
and her thoughts were not following his words.</p>

<p>He was piqued and mortified. He could not believe
that she would not yield to the things that she had often
enjoyed before in his conversation. In fact, it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
a source of much pleasure to him to tell her of rare experiences
he had had in travel and watch the flush of her
cheek and the glow in her eye as she enjoyed it with him.
It cut him that he could not reach her, that she had withdrawn
her friendliness. It mortified his pride and his
sense of superiority. And most of all it hurt him in his
self-love. Perhaps he would have named it love for her,
for he had come during the winter to recognize that that
was what he felt for this girl; and seeing that was the
case, he was the more determined to mold and make her
as she should be to fit his walk and station in life. Albeit,
his love for any one was merely another name for self-love.
He wanted her and her love merely to make himself
more complete for himself, and so he was really in
love with himself all the time.</p>

<p>For the rest of the ride Joyce was absolutely silent,
and when they alighted at the station and started toward
her home she said nothing, and she walked a trifle apart
from him and ignored the arm he offered.</p>

<p>In a sudden yearning for his heart&#8217;s desire, he took
her hand and drew it within his arm, holding her hand in
a firm warm grasp and speaking with a new tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce, don&#8217;t you know why I have spoken to you
as I have? Don&#8217;t you know that it is because I love you,
because I cannot bear to see your brilliant mind filled with
such twaddle, such nonsense, such rot&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; she cried, wrenching her hand away from
his clasp. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever dare to speak such words to
me again! Don&#8217;t dare to talk about the wonderful words
of inspiration in that way. It is blasphemy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, trying to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
possession of her hand once more, &#8220;you have wholly
misunderstood me. The words of Scripture are just as
beautiful to me, and just as sacred in their way as they
are to you. It is a mere difference of the way of looking
at them. Now I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harrington, I am not interested in how you look
at the Bible. I would rather not hear you tell about it.
You have filled me with horror.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not interested that I am telling you that I
love you?&#8221; he asked in deep impassioned tones. &#8220;I am
asking you now to be my wife? Cannot we put these
trivial things away and be one in spirit now?&#8221; He leaned
toward her gently and tried to capture the little gloved
hand once more.</p>

<p>But Joyce quickly put her Bible in it and drew away
from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she said. &#8220;No. We could never be one in
spirit or in anything else while you deny the inspiration of
the Scriptures and call those wonderful expositions that
we heard tonight rot and twaddle and nonsense. You are
one of those people that it warns against in the Bible:
&#8216;Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy, and
vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments
of the world, and not after Christ.&#8217; It also says: &#8216;Avoiding
profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science,
falsely so called.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Joyce, please don&#8217;t quote Scripture at me. Let
us drop that. If we love each other those things will
settle themselves by and by. Let us talk a little while
about ourselves. Tell me, you love me, Joyce, don&#8217;t you?
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve seen it in your eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joyce frankly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I do. I
don&#8217;t think it would be possible for me to love any one
who thought of the things that are the most precious to
me in the way you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, those things aside, you really in your heart
love me? Tell me you do, Joyce. I long to hear you
say the words. Just speak out your own true heart.
Once that question is settled, the other things will all fall
in line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t put those things aside, Professor Harrington.
They are a part of my soul. Nothing counts without
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. They had almost reached
Joyce&#8217;s little home. He suddenly turned her about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us walk back down this next street. It is not
late, and if you will not let me come into your house,
at least we can walk a little longer. I must have this
question settled tonight. I cannot let this separation go
on between us any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The question so far as I am concerned is settled
now,&#8221; she said firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Joyce, if it were not for this difference? Suppose
I thought as you do, would you say yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce hesitated. Theirs had been a pleasant companionship
in a way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell,&#8221; she said thoughtfully. &#8220;It would have
made so much difference, I cannot tell how I would
have felt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said triumphantly. &#8220;You see, I was
right. You do love me, only you are so filled with this
fanaticism that you won&#8217;t let yourself see it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; said Joyce gravely. &#8220;I have
never even considered it, because from the first of my
acquaintance I have known that you were this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This way? <i>What way?</i>&#8221; he asked sharply. It hurt
him to have her criticise him now, when he had declared
his love for her. Joyce thought a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not believe. You do not understand the
things of the Spirit. You base whatever faith you have
on the wisdom of men, not in the power of God.
Haven&#8217;t you ever heard that the wisdom of this world
is foolishness with God?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are talking around in a circle,&#8221; said Harrington
crossly. &#8220;I was speaking of loving one another. From
the moment I laid eyes upon you I knew that you were
mine. Does it mean nothing to you that I came after you
when I did not even know who you were? Does it mean
nothing that the vision of your face stayed in my
heart&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the moment I laid eyes on you I knew that you
were not mine,&#8221; said Joyce suddenly. &#8220;It is getting very
late. Hear! The clocks are striking twelve. I must go
home this minute!&#8221; Her heart had suddenly gone into
a panic. She wanted to get away by herself and think.
Life was a strange thing. Was this man going to insist
on being in her life?</p>

<p>Harrington, deeply offended, led her to her home in
silence. She bade him good night and received a stiff good
night in answer. He stalked away in the moonlight, a
handsome picture of a man with a rising future, and much
that was good and beautiful for a maiden to think upon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
Yet she turned into her little warm room as to a haven,
and knelt down by her couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear heavenly Father! Keep me. Don&#8217;t let
me get bewildered by things. I don&#8217;t want to love any one
now, please. And I know he isn&#8217;t a right one to love.&#8221;</p>

<p>From that night forth she unconsciously ceased to pray
for him. It seemed somehow as if her duty were done
there, and it was not for her to further seek his salvation.
It seemed almost to her as if he desired her soul&#8217;s destruction,
so determined had he been to drag her away into
his world. It almost frightened her when she thought
about it. For several days thereafter she kept to herself
as much as possible when at school.</p>

<p>For several days Harrington maintained a grave aloofness
toward her, did not come to her room, nor appear
in the hall when she would be likely to be about. When
he needed to give a message to her he sent it through
one of the seniors, or wrote a stiff note signing himself
J. S. Harrington.</p>

<p>Joyce felt that she was being punished, and managed
not to have to go to the office at all that week. She never
had been a frequenter of his office at any time, however,
so that was scarcely noticeable.</p>

<p>But one morning he happened to pass her room quite
early, before scarcely anybody had entered the building,
and he heard her singing softly to herself as she put the
arithmetic problems on the blackboard for the day.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;And He walks with me, and He talks with me,</div>
<div class="indent">And He tells me I am His own;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh the joy we share as we tarry there</div>
<div class="indent">None other has ever known&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>The words were the words of a hymn, he knew, one
of those he had once criticised as being &#8220;emotional twaddle,&#8221;
yet there was something exquisitely lovely and dear
in the way she sang it, the perfect confidence of her soul
in that One in whom she trusted expressed in those simple
words. He glanced at her wistfully as he passed the door
and took in all the slender grace of her pose, as the white
fingers, holding the chalk, made rapid lines of figures
on the board. The sun made a bright background of beaten
gold, outlining the lovely head, and he glanced back wistfully.
Here was a rare girl indeed. Why, in this age
of progress, should it be that such a choice flower of
womanhood should be tainted with a primitive fanaticism?
It was as if she were a flower left over from the Victorian
age, out of place in a world that had grown beyond her&mdash;exquisite,
yet impractical. How could she possibly hope
to get on in the world with such notions?</p>

<p>In the calm reflections of the night&mdash;of several nights&mdash;in
which he had lain awake and gone over their last
conversation, he had chided himself severely for going so
far. He simply must not let himself go again, not until
he was sure that he could make her over. Never would
it do for him to hamper his future with one who was so
utterly unadaptable to life as he found her up to date. It
simply would ruin his career.</p>

<p>Yet that afternoon he made a special trip to town to
find a certain book, one written in the vague modern shibboleth,
sweet and mystical, with the emphasis on loving
one another, and being able to see the good in everybody,
and the next morning, with a perfect rose just coming
out of bud, she found it lying on her desk. No name,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
just the rose and the book. Of course she knew who
put them there, but if she had not, his smile and greeting
as he passed her in the hall would have told her. And
that day she prayed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Father, help me. Keep me.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Tyke came back from Canada there was vengeance
in his eye. It had not taken him long to find out
that there was no such street and number as Lib had given
him, but he did not turn about and flee home without first
examining every inch of the city where there might be a
possible clue to Darcy. He went to the General Delivery
and asked for letters for Darcy Sherwood. He even stood
for hours behind a pillar in the post-office and watched
the comers and goers, hoping to find Darcy among them.
He walked over the city in daytime and at night, examined
its haunts and amusements, looked over the hotel registries,
and searched in a number of places where it seemed likely
to him he might find his former partner, but no trace did
he find of Darcy.</p>

<p>The first meeting with his three friends after his return
was not very satisfactory. They chided him for his
absence, derided him for going to Canada at all at the
instigation of a sharp child, and charged him with trying
to serve his own ends by the delay. They even went so
far as to suggest that perhaps he was in with Darcy himself
and this was all a big bluff. Tyke drew off and fairly
bellowed at them in his wrath, and finally settled down
to a plan which he said would bring things to a climax
within a week. The four heads were bent together long
over a paper on which Cottar was jotting down suggestions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
for Tyke to act upon. It was Tyke, after all, who was
made to play the part out in the open. And once, while
they were talking in a little shanty far away from the
town, with a bit of a candle in an old lantern for light,
and their paper spread out on a rough box, there came a
face at the window, a long, white, thin old face with only
two teeth, one above and one below; a long heavy wisp
of snow-white hair straggling over a high yellow forehead,
and watery, faded eyes, yet keen, watching them.
It ducked down when Tyke lifted his head once and looked
nervously that way as a twig rubbed up and down on the
roof in the wind from the old apple-tree outside, but the
eyes peered up again and watched long and silently, listening;
and crouched when the men put out the lantern and
stole away into the night. It was only old Noah Casey,
harmless and wandering about again, escaped from the
poor farm, and travelling some of the old roads of his
youth. Nobody minded old Noah, though he gave them
a start now and then.</p>

<p>He was following a voice now, the voice he had heard
loudest inside the shanty, the voice of the one with the
red hair. Crouching low, he stole from tuft to tuft of
the marshy grass, a thing of the night, old, flighty, his
worn garment colorless like weathered wood, his wisps of
hair blowing like gray clouds about his mild, anxious face
from under the tattered felt hat. A bent old gnome in
the dark, with something on his mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> in the early spring one night just as Eugene
and Nan were about to retire, the telephone bell rang and
a man&#8217;s voice asked if Mr. Massey was at home, and if
he could see some one on important business connected
with his cousin Miss Radway.</p>

<p>Eugene was immediately excited, and fairly shouted
into the telephone, demanding to know who was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, pard. I ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; all I know over
the wire. Alone now? I&#8217;ll drop around. This is absolutely
Q. T. you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan stood trembling in the doorway, white-faced,
frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to bed!&#8221; ordered Eugene, trying to still the
excitement of his own voice, and getting up to pace the
room nervously. &#8220;Go to bed, I say!&#8221; he roared as Nan
still stood in the doorway watching him.</p>

<p>There was a wild look in his eye that made her afraid
of him sometimes. He had been hard toward her ever
since she falteringly told him of her visit to the minister,
and he had looked at her as if she had been a viper and
answered her only:</p>

<p>&#8220;You FOOL! If you could only learn to keep your
mouth shut! Yes, weep. WEEP! That&#8217;s your line!
Oh, why did I marry <i>a fool</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Since that day Nan had kept much to herself, had not
ventured to take any part in the frantic search for Joyce
that was still going on in a stealthy way. Now, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
look in her husband&#8217;s eye, she vanished, sobbing softly
to herself, went hurriedly up the stairs and flung herself
noisily on the bed. A moment later she rose stealthily,
removed her shoes and prepared to listen to whatever went
on downstairs. Her heart was beating so wildly that
she had to put her hand on it, it almost hurt.</p>

<p>Eugene forestalled any attempt on her part to listen
by closing the doors of the sitting room, and her only
possibility of finding out anything lay in the back staircase
or in watching out the window.</p>

<p>The night was dark and a ghoulish wind was roaring
about the house, a real March night with dark clouds driven
across a starless sky. She could not even see the stealthy
figure like a flat shadow that slid across the open space
before the door and flattened against the side of the
house some minutes before the knock that echoed so
slightly she almost thought she was mistaken. She heard
the door open and blow shut with a gust of wind, and
there were voices, low murmurs, that was all. She strained
her ears to hear, for she felt sure Gene would not tell her
anything. He said she was a fool and he could not
trust her.</p>

<p>Downstairs, in the sitting room, Tyke stood flat
against the wall by the door and ordered Gene to pull down
the shades. This done, he selected a seat in the darkest corner
of the room and motioned Gene to a seat in front
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You plumb sure thar ain&#8217;t no one lis&#8217;nen in on us?&#8221;
he asked, eyeing the various doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Positive,&#8221; said Gene, eyeing his caller suspiciously.
This man of course wanted money, and he wasn&#8217;t a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
pleasant-looking customer. Perhaps he ought to have sent
for a policeman and had him in hiding. Yet there might
be something he would not have wanted a policeman to
know. No, rather take the chances himself. He glanced
nervously toward the telephone to make sure he could
reach it from where he sat in case he needed it. Nan, of
course, would be worse than useless in an emergency. Still,
perhaps he had made a mistake in sending her to bed.
However, he felt pretty sure she would manage to find a
cranny to listen, and when he heard a soft creaking on
the back stairs and saw Tyke start nervously, he made
no move.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a mouse in the wall,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I came here purely out o&#8217; kin&#8217;ness,&#8221; began Tyke
ingratiatingly, his eyes roving from door to window and
back again. &#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;war I&#8217;m doin&#8217; a dangerous thing; an&#8217;
I&#8217;m riskin&#8217; m&#8217;life. The man we gotta deal with is a desp&#8217;rate
feller, an&#8217; he wouldn&#8217;t stop at nothin&#8217;. We gotta
work still as death ur we won&#8217;t get nowheres. Now, to
begin, &#8217;bout how long uv you ben sure your young woman
relative was kidnapped?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kidnapped!&#8221; said Gene with a start. &#8220;Kidnapped.
Yes. Why&mdash;&#8221; Then it was money the man wanted.
&#8220;Why&mdash;I&#8217;ve been coming slowly to that conclusion for
sometime. Haven&#8217;t been able to prove it yet of course&mdash;That
is&mdash;&#8221; Here, he was telling too much himself. He
oughtn&#8217;t to tell this man anything. He ought to let the
man do all the talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I kin,&#8221; said Tyke, unconsciously raising his
voice a trifle. &#8220;Got four good witnesses &#8217;sides myse&#8217;f
to prove it in court. Know the very day an&#8217; hour when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
happened. We all seen the body, and one of us seen him
buryin&#8217; her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Body!&#8221; exclaimed Gene, jumping up, white to the
lips. &#8220;Burying!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit still, man! Keep yer shirt on! We don&#8217;t get nowheres
carryin&#8217; on with them highstrikes. Somebody
might be round an&#8217; hear ya. You can&#8217;t never tell. You
gotta learn to keep quiet ef you wantta hear what I got
ta say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Gene with dry lips and stiff articulation.
The horror of it froze his senses. In spite of him his
mother&#8217;s face came reproachfully between him and the
stranger. What had he done to Joyce? How had he been
responsible for all this that had happened to her? He was
not a bad man. He did not want her inheritance at the
expense of her life. He was merely a selfish man. This
girl was his own blood and kin, and he was responsible
for her safety. Fear sat upon his face. What might not
come to him when the town heard this?</p>

<p>But the stranger was asking him a question.</p>

<p>With an effort he pulled himself back to attend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just when did you say you seen her last? April?
Twenty-four? Yep. That&#8217;s the day. Long toward evenin&#8217;
wasn&#8217;t it? She went down acrost lots to her yants
grave, didn&#8217;t she? What say? You didn&#8217;t know that?
Oh, I thought&mdash;well, it don&#8217;t matter. That&#8217;s where she
went, and he met her thar. Must uv had a date. He was
waitin&#8217; there for her. You see we was doin&#8217; some work
there round a lot, in the cem&#8217;try, me an&#8217; a couppla others,
an&#8217; when we got back home we found we hadta go &#8217;nother
place next day so we walks back t&#8217;get our tools we&#8217;d lef&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
hid. Seein&#8217; there was somebody there seemin&#8217; to be
feelin&#8217; bad&mdash;she was cryin&#8217; real hard, an&#8217; he was coaxin&#8217;
her&mdash;we didn&#8217;t like to intrude, so we set awhile under
the hedge thinkin&#8217; he&#8217;d get away. We knowed him, ya
know, a great one with the dames. They always fall fer
him, no matter what they are! Pretty soon we see &#8217;em
walk away down a piece to the road jes&#8217; as we thought
they would, only she was talkin&#8217; fast, an&#8217; cryin&#8217;. Still we
didn&#8217;t think nothin&#8217; of it, knowin&#8217; him an&#8217; all, till suddenly
we seen him pick her up strugglin&#8217; and chuck her into a
autymobile he had standin&#8217; there, an&#8217; fore we could sense
what was goin&#8217; on they was off down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;We talked it over an&#8217; we come to the conclusion it
was just a little quarrel they was havin&#8217; an&#8217; none o&#8217; our business.
But two days after that Billy he missed one o&#8217; his
wedges, an&#8217; he reckoned he musta lef&#8217; it up to the cem&#8217;try,
so we all decides to walk up, bein&#8217; a pleasant evenin&#8217;, jus&#8217;
fer the walk. On the way we talked about the girl we&#8217;d
seen an&#8217; decided to look at the headstone an&#8217; see if we
could make out if she was a relative of ennybody we
knowed. I ain&#8217;t from Meadow Brook myself but I got
frien&#8217;s buried up there. But when we come in sight o&#8217;
the cem&#8217;try we seen that there car thar again, jus&#8217; in the
same place, kinda hid like behind the alders, backed down
off the road, an&#8217; we listened, an&#8217; heard the ring of a spade.
We thought that was queer, an&#8217; we clum the bank an&#8217; stole
round to the back of the cem&#8217;try where we could see. We
hadta go awful still, cause he stopped every now an&#8217; agen
to listen, but we fin&#8217;lly got where we could see, an&#8217; he
was diggin&#8217; a grave!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Gene caught his breath and Tyke sat watching him
cautiously to see just how far he could go with his tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thur was a long bundle did up in a carridge robe
layin&#8217; on the ground, and bime bye when he&#8217;d dug a long
time he turns around and he listens, an&#8217; then he snaps on
his flashlight, an&#8217; turns back the cloth an&#8217; there was &#8217;er
face, jes&#8217; as plain, same girl as we&#8217;d seen settin&#8217; on the
grave, only dead as a door-nail. Her face shone bright
in his light an&#8217; we couldn&#8217;t make no mistake. Then he
covers up her face an&#8217; snaps off the light and rolls her into
the hole, an&#8217; we could hear the dirt bein&#8217; shovelled down
in again, an&#8217; me an&#8217; my pards were weak as little babies.
We couldn&#8217;t do nothin&#8217;, jes&#8217; lay in the grass there an&#8217;
never moved till we hear his autymobile chuggin&#8217; down the
road. We was most too scared to speak then. An&#8217; we
got away acrost the fields an&#8217; never come home till mornin&#8217;
we was so plumb scared.</p>

<p>&#8220;We was tryin&#8217; to figger out what to do, but next
thing we heard the girl had went away visitin&#8217;, an&#8217; we
figgered it out that what you didn&#8217;t know wouldn&#8217;t never
make you all feel bad, so we kep&#8217; our mouths shet. But
here lately, I ain&#8217;t ben sleepin&#8217; well. Keep a dreamin&#8217; I see
that there girl with her purty white face a cryin&#8217; out to me
fer justice to be done on that there feller, an&#8217; I made up
my mind I wouldn&#8217;t hold back no longer, I&#8217;d tell you the
truth, an&#8217; you kin do what you like about it. My han&#8217;s is
washed clean, enyhow. But if you all want ter prosecute
him its a clear case of murder in the first degree, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll
all stan&#8217; by ya.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t told me who the man is,&#8221; said Gene,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
his breath coming fast and his eyes taking on a wild look.
&#8220;Murder! Think of it! To one of our family!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I &#8217;sposed you knowed a course. Ain&#8217;t he ben
comin&#8217; here to see her? I knowed he was here the night
after he took her away &#8217;cause I seen him myself, follered
him to the gate. Fact, there ain&#8217;t been much happened to
him sence that I ain&#8217;t knowed &#8217;bout. Had him watched,
ya know. Can&#8217;t take no chances with a feller like that.
Why, his name is Sherwood. Darcy Sherwood. Great
baseball pitcher. Often had his name in the paper. That
kind takes the girls ya know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darcy Sherwood! Of course!&#8221; said Gene. &#8220;Where
is he now? I&#8217;ll get out a warrant for arrest tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the rub,&#8221; said Tyke uneasily. &#8220;You see
he got away a few days back. He&#8217;s ben keepin&#8217; close, and
been away a lot, but he musta got onto it that we had
him spotted fer he made tracks fer Canada. I follered
him up there, but found he&#8217;d left, given a wrong address
an&#8217; all that. But he&#8217;s back somewheres in this neighborhood.
I&#8217;m sure o&#8217;that. You jes&#8217; wantta put it in the han&#8217;s
of the p&#8217;lice an&#8217; you&#8217;ll get yer party all right, all right!
Better not tell who yer witnesses are till ya get him safe
an&#8217; sound in jail, though. He mighta got onto the fact
of who we are an&#8217; cleared out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gene&#8217;s mind had run rapidly ahead of the visitor&#8217;s
words. He was thinking fast what he had to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must dig up that grave and find the body,&#8221; he
said, speaking rapidly. &#8220;You can locate it, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. We can locate her all right; but it ain&#8217;t no
use diggin&#8217; it up. Didn&#8217;t I tell ya that part? This other
party, this fourth man I was speakin&#8217; of fer a witness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
he ain&#8217;t one of my bunch at all. He was just goin&#8217; through
the medder adjoinin&#8217; next night after the burryin&#8217; an&#8217; he
heard a sound of a spade and he steps to the hedge curious
like to see who was diggin&#8217; a grave that time o&#8217; night, it
was still kinda light, an&#8217; he sees this feller diggin&#8217; her up,
an&#8217; presently he takes up the big roll an&#8217; carries it away
in a car. Got scared likely. Thought somebody was onto
him, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t dast leave her there. My man went an&#8217;
looked in the hole after he was gone an&#8217; there wasn&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; there but broken glass. After that we went too,
an&#8217; it&#8217;s all true just as he sez. So he&#8217;s got away with it
all good an&#8217; slick. He&#8217;s an awful slick feller. I knowed
him back in France. I got an idea where he may have hid
her though. There&#8217;s more&#8217;n one graveyard round these
diggin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late that night Eugene let Tyke out the back door,
and he stole away into the mists like some creeping thing
to hide. But Eugene walked the floor all night, his white
face drawn and pinched, his eyes bloodshot and looking
like hidden fires. There was something more than revenge
working in Eugene Massey&#8217;s heart. There was conscience.
One cannot have a mother like Mary Massey without having
to suffer for it some time or other, if one has wandered
away from her teachings.</p>

<p>And all night long Nan lay in her bed with wide-open
eyes and tried to piece together the few words she had
overheard from her perch on the back stairs, and make
sense out of them&mdash;lay and dreaded the coming of
the morning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening late in March Joyce was coming out
from the Bible School on the way to her train. She had
omitted the second class that evening because she had
papers to correct when she got home and it would keep
her up very late if she waited until the late train.</p>

<p>As she came into the street a gust of wind caught
her hat and flung it along the pavement. She darted out
after it, and after quite a race captured it, but not till
several large drops of rain had fallen in her face. She
turned to hurry toward the station. It was not a long
walk, and she usually preferred to do it on foot rather
than to wait for trolleys, which were few and far between
on that side street. But it was all too evident that a
storm was upon her. Dust and papers and litter were
being blown along in the gutter, and the wind lifted in
wild swoops and banged signs and shutters and any loose
object in sight. People hurried to cover, umbrellas were
raised and lowered quickly, or the wind seized them and
turned them inside out. People in automobiles hurriedly
fastened on side curtains, and the street was almost deserted
in a trice.</p>

<p>Joyce turned to see if a car was coming, but none was
in sight. She held her hat, and ducking her head, hurried
on as fast as she could fly, but at the second corner the
wind took her and almost tore her from the sidewalk. It
was with difficulty she regained her footing and huddled by
some steps with her hand on a building to steady her. Then
the rain fell in torrents, and she turned and scurried blindly
into an open doorway a few feet away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>Other people had taken refuge there also, they were
crowding in and Joyce was pushed with the throng inside
the door, not knowing what kind of a place she was entering.
But there were other women in the company, caught
in the storm as was she, so she was not frightened. Before
she had opportunity to look around and know where she
was a burst of song broke about her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;Free from the law! O happy condition!</div>
<div class="verse">Jesus hath bled and there is remission!</div>
<div class="verse">Cursed by the law, and bruised by the fall,</div>
<div class="verse">Christ hath redeemed us once for all.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;Once for all, O sinner, receive it!</div>
<div class="verse">Once for all, O brother, believe it!</div>
<div class="verse">Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,</div>
<div class="verse">Christ hath redeemed us once for all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was a religious meeting of some sort, right there
in the heart of the city!</p>

<p>She pressed in at last where she could stand behind
the last row of chairs next to the aisle and see the platform.
A piano was there and a girl playing the hymn. A young
man was playing on a cornet, and there were singers and
some men seated in chairs behind a low desk table.</p>

<p>She forgot that she was missing her train in her deep
interest in the meeting, and her own voice joined eagerly
in the old hymn she had known ever since she could
remember:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Now we are free&mdash;there&#8217;s no condemnation,</div>
<div class="verse">Jesus provides a perfect salvation:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;Come unto me,&#8217; oh, hear His sweet call,</div>
<div class="verse">Come, and He saves us, once for all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Her eyes swept over the congregation. Men and
women and children were there, people of plain dress,
mostly, some young giddy children of the street, some old
men in worn garments, a few tired-looking women, not
many mighty. Back by the door, caught as herself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
storm were a few better-dressed people, in luxurious furs
and velvets, people obviously amused at their surroundings,
as they would have been equally amused if they had dropped
into an opium joint for the moment, or a travelling circus,
or a Hindoo temple, or any other alien environment.</p>

<p>But Joyce felt that she had dropped in on home and
her heart went out in the song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;Children of God,&#8217; oh, glorious calling,</div>
<div class="verse">Surely His grace will keep us from falling:</div>
<div class="verse">Passing from death to life at His call,</div>
<div class="verse">Blessed salvation once for all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The congregation rustled into their seats with the
closing chorus and gave Joyce a full view of the people
on the platform. A man with a good voice that could
be heard out in the street was speaking now. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you go home I want you to listen to somebody
else a moment. A dear brother came to me tonight
wanting to tell me what Christ had done for him, and I
have asked him if he will tell you what he told me. He
says he is not a public speaker, but when I put it to him
that he might help somebody else he consented.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some one stepped to the front of the platform and
began to speak. A man just in front of Joyce rose up
at that instant and put on his overcoat, and she could not
see the platform for a moment, but the voice rang into
her soul like a song of long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to talk about myself,&#8221; said the speaker,
&#8220;never did, but when your leader showed me a verse in
my new Bible that said: &#8216;If thou confess with thy mouth
the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath
raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved!&#8217; I had to
do what he asked, because I <i>believe</i>, and I want to <i>confess</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce&#8217;s heart stood still with wonder and then went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
flying on in great glad leaps and bounds. There could
not be two voices like that one. She stretched her neck
to see, and when the man ahead of her sat down, there
was Darcy Sherwood standing on the platform, with a
new grave look upon his face, and he was saying the most
wonderful thing:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a sinner all my life, but I never knew it
until one day God sent a woman to look into my eyes and
ask me what I was doing. I was in the bootlegging business
then and doing pretty well. It had never occurred
to me that there was anything like what you&#8217;d call sin
about it. But it began to seem as if somehow God had
got into that woman&#8217;s eyes and was looking at me. I
saw that the breaking of the law of the land that had
been made for the good of the land was a sin. I was a
law-breaker and I was a sinner. And somehow that sin
grew until it was the heaviest thing I had to carry around.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave up bootlegging right away that night, but
somehow that didn&#8217;t seem to make any difference. The
sin was there just the same and it grew heavier and heavier
on my soul. I never knew I had a soul before that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard a Bible story read long ago about a blind
man, and there was one verse I always remembered. It
said: &#8216;If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now
ye say, we see; therefore your sin remaineth.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I began to see that was just like me. I had always
prided myself on seeing what was right and doing it. I
had been a law to myself. But now I saw that was all
wrong. I had no right to make my own laws. There
had to be somebody wiser than I who could make the laws
for everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bought a Bible and began to read, and presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
I began to see that there was something else back of it
all that I hadn&#8217;t got at all yet. There was something bigger
than federal laws. I had broken the law of the
land and I could go and pay the penalty of that and wipe it
out, but there was a higher law, a law of the universe, that
my spirit had been breaking, and I didn&#8217;t see any way
to wipe out that debt, pay that penalty. In fact, I didn&#8217;t
know that higher law, and how was I to keep from breaking
it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Then one day I came on a verse that said: &#8216;And
this is his commandment, that we should believe on the
name of his son Jesus Christ.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it was! I hadn&#8217;t been doing that, and I was
a sinner. I could see how God would be very angry
with me about that. God, to be a God, holy and good
and all that a real God would be, and I a little creature
setting up myself to not believe on Him! It really seemed
a reasonable offense. As I thought about it, it seemed
greater than killing anybody, or robbing a bank, or forging,
or any of the things we count sins in the world. It
seemed&mdash;well&mdash;so contemptible in me. And the more
I felt it, the more I didn&#8217;t like the feeling, and I kept on
reading my Bible.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Bible is a pretty nice kind of a Bible. I suppose
you all know about it. It is called a Scofield Bible
and it has little explanations and notes here and there that
lead you on and that let you in on the meaning of a word
in the original Hebrew or Greek, and make it a lot plainer
to a beginner like me. By and by, after I had worried
about my sin a lot, I found that I didn&#8217;t need to worry at
all&mdash;that my sin had all been prepared for, and the penalty
paid; that Jesus Christ had set me free from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
law of sin and death, and all I had to do was accept my
pardon and go out unburdened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there isn&#8217;t much more to tell. I took it. You
better believe I did! If you had been as unhappy as I
was you wouldn&#8217;t have wasted a minute in taking a pardon
like that. Why don&#8217;t you, by the way, if you never
have? It pays. I&#8217;m here to tell you it pays <i>above everything
else I&#8217;ve ever tried</i>. If you don&#8217;t see it, just try it
anyway, and you&#8217;ll find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The audience rose to join in the closing hymn, and
during that and the benediction Joyce&#8217;s heart was in a
tumult of joy. She could not see the platform because
the two men who stood in front of her were unusually
tall, and some people had come in and were standing in
the aisle beside her, crowding her from her position, but
the instant the benediction was over she set herself to
get up that aisle somehow. However, she might as well
have attempted to throw herself out to sea when the tide
was coming in. It was impossible to make any progress,
and finally she slipped into the back seat and decided to
wait. She must see Darcy at any risk, no matter if she
lost the next train. She must tell him how glad she was!</p>

<p>There was a crowd around the platform. Likely people
had come up to speak to him. His words rang over
again in her heart as she waited, her eyes lighted with a
great joy. At last the crowd thinned and she managed
to work her way through and get to the front, but as
she did so she saw several men going out a door back
of the platform, and when she arrived there was but
one man left up there, seemingly a janitor, picking up
the books. Her heart sank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, can you tell me where the speakers have gone?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
I must see one of them a minute, that last man, Mr.
Sherwood!&#8221; she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him? Oh, he went while they was singin&#8217;, lady, hed
to ketch a train. I showed him the way to the station.
Good, wa&#8217;n&#8217;t he? Beats all what the Lord does when He
gets a chance at a soul&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Joyce had gone, down the aisle with swift steps,
out into the street where it was still raining briskly, and
the water pouring along the gutter in deep angry tides.
She paid no heed. She fled along on winged feet, across
the water, down another block; wet and breathless, she
arrived at last at the station.</p>

<p>She did not glance at the clock to see if she had missed
her train; she hurried out to the gates, and scanned every
entrance to a train, but the man was just closing the gate
and slipping down the sign for the New York express,
which was moving away in the distance, and there was
no other train sign up except her own, the last one out
to Silverton that night. She glanced at the clock. There
were three minutes before it left. She cast a despairing
glance around. He was probably gone on that train to
New York and she had missed her chance of telling him
how glad she was. She must go home of course. She
would be in a terrible predicament if she missed that train,
and had to stay in the station all night, for she had no
money for lodging and would not have known where
to go if she had. And there were her examination papers.</p>

<p>The guard had his hand on the gate and his eye on the
clock. She hurried through the gates and onto the train,
sinking into a seat just as the train began to move, and
feeling a rush of bitter disappointment so deep she could
hardly restrain the tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>Yet beneath it all, as she put her head down on her
hand and tried to control her feelings, there was a deep
gladness. Her prayers had been answered. Darcy had
found the way home. The horror of that night in the cemetery
was all cleared away. She had her friend once more,
whether he ever knew it or not.</p>

<p>Afterwards, while the wheels were turning in a drowsy
tune, and the sleepy passengers, with closed eyes, were
trying to snatch a bit of rest on the way, her heart woke
up and began to tell over to her every word that he had
spoken, every precious look that showed his heart was
changed, every intonation of the voice she had known so
long. And to think the Lord had used her to make him
listen to God&#8217;s voice! Oh, it was too dear, too wonderful!</p>

<p>The look of glory stayed on her face the next morning
as she came blithely through the hall at school and met
the young professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look as though you had fallen heir to a fortune,&#8221;
he said sourly, as though he begrudged her her happy heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I have,&#8221; she said brightly and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you share it?&#8221; he said wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t share.
You wouldn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know I wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; he said crossly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she tried to explain. &#8220;It&#8217;s just&mdash;that I&#8217;ve
heard from home.&#8221; Her eyes were all alight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he said rudely, and turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another man in Meadow Brook,&#8221; he told
himself gloomily. &#8220;I must do something about this right
away. I&#8217;m a fool, but I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At recess time he entered Joyce&#8217;s classroom with a
smile and handed her a newspaper still in its wrapper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a paper from Meadow Brook that just came
in the mail. I thought perhaps it might interest you.
There&#8217;s a boy in High School there who persists in thinking
that I&#8217;m interested in their baseball team, and every
time they win a game I get a sheaf of papers. Of course
they don&#8217;t interest me. I hardly remember the names of
people there any more. I was there so short a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce thanked him and put the paper in her desk for
a leisure moment, going on with the blackboard exercise
she was writing. Harrington was disappointed. He had
hoped she would open the paper in his presence, and he
might perhaps get some clue to her interest in Meadow
Brook, but she was as cool and disinterested as a lily.
Well, he must find a way to keep her in his company, there
was no other way. It was against all his principles to be
too attentive until he felt she was worthy of his position,
but there seemed to be no other way, with her. It was
perhaps, after all, a proof that she was really worth while
that she held herself aloof. Or could it possibly be subtlety?
No, he decided not. Her religion was genuine, and
that would preclude subtlety. Well, at least her method
had shown him his own heart, and now he must find a
way to win out, for it was getting toward spring and
he must have this matter settled before he went away on
his vacation. He had an eye to another larger school
with better pay. It would be an advantage to him to
have it known that he was engaged to a personable young
woman. It was a wealthy community, where he was hoping
to be called, and Joyce would shine in such society
with a little tutoring from him, always providing of course
that he could rid her of her ridiculous fanaticism.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> morning Darcy received Lib Knox&#8217;s letter.</p>

<p>He was passing through a city where he had been
in the habit of receiving mail, and he stopped to see if
anything was in the box for him, and to pay his box rent
and give it up. There he found the letter.</p>

<p>His face grew tender and stern as he read. Dear little
brave Lib. Well he knew who the bad man with red
hair must be, but how did Tyke ever find out Lib? Some
deviltry somewhere. But one thing was certain, he must
abandon his plans and go home to protect her. He would
take Tyke out in the open somewhere and give him a lesson
if necessary.</p>

<p>He glanced at the date on the letter and frowned.
Already he had been in ignorance too long. There was
time enough for any number of things to have happened
to Lib, and well he knew that Tyke was a bad man. To
the warning concerning his own welfare he paid no heed
whatever, passing over Lib&#8217;s solicitude for him with a
tender smile.</p>

<p>More alarmed than he cared to own even to himself,
he studied up time-tables and took the first train that
would make connections for Meadow Brook. He must
tell Mason to look after Lib better. They were too careless
with that child. As soon as his quest was over he must
try and do something about Lib. She wasn&#8217;t being
brought up in the right way. She wasn&#8217;t being taught
right and wrong. She was too much on her own, just
as he had been. That must all be changed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>So he boarded the train for home, and on the way he
closed his eyes and tried to exercise his new power of
prayer. What he was praying for was that he might find
Joyce Radway, and as the train rumbled along he began
to think to himself that perhaps, after all, he had been a
fool. He had got interested in his quest as a quest and
had not remembered that it might by this time be unnecessary.
For aught he knew she might have reached home.</p>

<p>Still, there was Dan Peterson. Dan always knew about
where to find him within a few days, and there had been
no word from Dan all along the line.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and tried to pray. He was just
learning to pray, and since he had read the promises to
those who prayed and believed, he had spent much time
upon this one petition: &#8220;Oh God, help me to find Joyce
and keep her safely.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was dark when Darcy reached Meadow Brook.
He had come by a way of his own and had not seen any
one he knew. He took the short cut across by the railroad
and in at the back gate, and so entered the house from
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>His sister was sitting by the diningroom table with
her head upon her arms, crying in the dark. Lib was
standing with her face flattened against the window-pane,
the slow tears coursing down her cheeks. Darcy reached
up and turned the light on, blinking at them wonderingly.
His first startled thought was that Mase must be dead.
He put out a hand gently and laid it on Ellen&#8217;s bowed head.
Good, simple Ellen!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>Ellen lifted her head and saw him and screamed,
dropping her face down again upon her folded arms and
breaking into renewed sobs. But Lib ran to him and
threw her arms around his neck, burying her wet little face
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>It was so he learned what had come to him, sitting in
a diningroom chair beside his sister with his hand upon
her bowed head and little Lib in his lap, her face against
his breast, sobbing as her mother told the story brokenly.
Mase, she said, was out trying to see a lawyer and find
out what to do. But there wasn&#8217;t anything to do. Everybody
said there wasn&#8217;t anything to do. The case was
all against him.</p>

<p>Darcy took the blow straight with white, stern face
and steady eyes. The hand that held little Lib&#8217;s did not
tremble and his voice did not shake. The thing he was
thinking was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I shall have to stop hunting for Joyce. Oh
God, take care of Joyce!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he opened his lips and said: &#8220;Well, Ellen, don&#8217;t
take it so hard! It&#8217;s all in the day&#8217;s work, and it&#8217;ll all
come out in the wash. Anyhow, Ellen, I&#8217;ve found a new
line. God isn&#8217;t forgetting any of us and you just put
that away and think about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen sat up and wiped her eyes and stared at him.
This was strange talk from Darcy, and yet it was like
him. She broke out afresh with indignant tears that they
should fasten a crime so heinous on this beloved brother.
She was engulfed, overwhelmed by the shame and disgrace
that had befallen them. She was old enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
have remembered their gentle mother who always tried
to keep them &#8220;respectable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Ellen, don&#8217;t cry any more. Give me
a bite to eat and I&#8217;ll go out and see what can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you mustn&#8217;t go out!&#8221; cried Ellen, and little
Lib gripped him fiercely. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t! They&#8217;ll get
you. They&#8217;re looking everywhere for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Darcy cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help
them. I&#8217;ll go and give myself up.&#8221;</p>

<p>And go he would in spite of all their efforts. He went
away whistling down the street, just as he always did
when he was at home. Whistling!</p>

<p>So first he went to the police headquarters and walked
in as he had done many a time before, and they stared
at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you&#8217;re looking for me?&#8221; he said,
gravely with a new dignity about him they scarcely
understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the chief, embarrassedly, almost deferentially,
for Darcy had been almost like one of themselves.
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well. Here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>They scarcely knew what to say to him. They treated
him like a gentleman, a stranger. It cut him the way they
went about it. They were not his friends any more.
It seemed that they were afraid of him, as if they did
not know how to take him. They had been prepared
for rebellion, subterfuge. He gave none. He was his
old grave self, with the old winning smile as he met them,
his eyes upon them with the old question in them, the wistfulness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
It disarmed them. They would have rather
had to fight with him.</p>

<p>And by and by he asked to see Dan Peterson. He
would find out if he had any friends left.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Joyce did not remember the Meadow Brook newspaper
again after she had put it into her desk, for almost
two weeks. It lay under a pile of copy books that were
awaiting marks and she had been too busy to get at them.
But one morning during study period she found time and
drew them out and there was the newspaper. She took
it out and was about to throw it in the waste basket,
realizing how much out of date it must be. Then a longing
overcame her to see some of the old familiar names
again, and she slipped off the wrapper and decided to take
just a moment to look it over before throwing it away.</p>

<p>It was well that the top of her desk was raised and
that the eyes of her young pupils were occupied with
their work, for the letters that met her gaze flaring across
the top of the paper in the blackest of type made her gasp
and turn white. They almost shouted at her as she read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">&#8220;BASEBALL IDOL IN TROUBLE!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">DARCY SHERWOOD WANTED ON CHARGE OF ABDUCTION<br />
AND MURDER OF JOYCE RADWAY</span></p>

<p class="center">Who left her home in Meadow Brook one year ago and<br />
has not been heard from since.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The article went on to state that there were eye-witnesses
to the murder and burial of the girl who were willing
to testify in the case. It was also rumored that
Eugene Massey, the cousin of the murdered girl, had located<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
the grave and exhumed the body which had been
identified by portions of clothing worn when Miss Radway
left her home. Meantime, Darcy Sherwood had also mysteriously
disappeared, some said to Canada, and a reward
was offered for any knowledge of him; although it was
also stated that the detectives had been right on his track
for months, and could easily locate and produce him when
he was needed.</p>

<p>For a moment Joyce thought she was going to faint.
It went through her mind to wonder if Harrington had
known what was in the paper when he gave it to her
and took this way to let her know it. But she rejected
the idea instantly. His manner had been too pleasant and
altogether intimate for that. He was one who could
never brook a thing like this publicity in an intimate
friend. His life was too well ordered and conventional
to make it possible to treat a girl just the same as ever
if he knew anything like this had been connected with
her name. Her next impulse was to hide the paper where
no eye could ever see it. She folded it quickly into a
thick square and stuffed it into her handbag. As she
did so its date caught her eye, and her heart froze within
her. It was more than two weeks back. What might not
have happened in that time? Darcy in such awful trouble
and she, the only one who could help him, chained to
these children.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> cast a helpless look around at the busy little
figures behind their desks. She glanced at the clock. It
was only half past nine. There was a train to the city
in three-quarters of an hour. She must make it. She
would have to go home for money, too, and to change
some of her things. She must get some one to take her
place, and she must manage it so that no one would ask her
any questions. Her brain seemed fairly burning up with
the rapidity of her thoughts.</p>

<p>Miss Beatty was a retired teacher who lived not far
away and who sometimes substituted when a teacher was
ill. Would she be at home now, and free? And how
could she get out to telephone her?</p>

<p>With fingers that trembled so that she could hardly
move her pencil she wrote a little note to the teacher of
the senior high school class and sent it by one of the
children. It read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Miss Clayton: Can you let me have Mary
Grover to keep order for a little while? I am obliged
to be out of the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Grover appeared in three or four minutes. Meantime
Joyce had summoned her senses and picked up everything
she did not want to leave in her desk, and slipped
out to the telephone booth in the hall. She dared not
take the time to run across the street to the drug store for
more privacy. While she waited for her number she prayed
that the Lord would arrange the way before her. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
head was throbbing so that she could scarcely see, and
her heart beating wildly. She did not dare to think except
just about getting to the train. It seemed if she did,
that she would have to cry out and shout the horror of
her soul at what had happened.</p>

<p>Queer that at such a time our breathless minds will
pick out trivialities and dwell upon them. During that
tense moment while she waited for her answer it came
to Joyce how Professor Harrington would smile in his
cynical way if he knew what she was doing, and ask her,
didn&#8217;t she think Miss Beatty would be at home just the
same if she didn&#8217;t pray? Then Miss Beatty&#8217;s precise
voice echoed reassuringly over the wire. &#8220;Yes? Ellen
Beatty at the phone!&#8221; and Joyce, with a thrill of triumph,
spoke in her trembling voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Beatty, I&#8217;m so glad you are there! I hope
you aren&#8217;t busy. This is Miss Radway at the school.
I&#8217;ve had bad news from home and I must catch this
next train. <i>Could</i> you take my place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I think so,&#8221; answered the kindly voice.
&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Joyce cut her off quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, then. Will you come over at once?
I&#8217;m leaving directions on the desk, and Mary Grover is
with the class till you get here. I haven&#8217;t a minute.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wrote a hurried note to Harrington there in the
telephone booth:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had bad news from home and must go at
once. Miss Beatty is taking my place. Did not want to
disturb your class, and had not a minute to wait. Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
telegraph if I cannot get back tomorrow. Sincerely,
Joyce Radway.&#8221;</p>

<p>She slipped back to her own room and despatched this
note by another delighted child, got her hat from the
dressing room and got away before Harrington had had
time to even open her note. She ran all the way home,
hastily changed her dress, put a few things into her little
brief case that she had bought at a bargain counter to
carry her papers in back and forth to school, and arrived
at the station with three or four minutes to spare and a
tumult in her heart that demanded an opportunity to cry.</p>

<p>Those three or four minutes seemed longer than the
whole preceding three-quarters of an hour, and she walked
to the far end of the platform and kept her eye out toward
the street. She somehow had a feeling that Harrington
would not like it that she had not consulted him before
going, and she was almost sure if he could make it that
he would come down to the train. But it had happened
that Harrington was busy with three guests from another
school, committeemen sent out to size him up, and Joyce&#8217;s
note lay harmlessly on his desk for half an hour before
he even had an opportunity to read it. Even then his
mind was so filled with wondering if he had made the
right impression that he scarcely took it in except to be
annoyed, for he had purposed taking the guests in to
Joyce&#8217;s room to show it off, intending later, if matters
developed sufficiently to whisper a suggestion that she
might be the future Mrs. Harrington. It was very annoying
of Joyce not to consult him. He would punish
her for that by coldness for a few days. She was altogether
too prone to take matters into her own hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
That&#8217;s what came of having an independent religion that
taught one to think in unconventional lines. He had no
thought of her trouble. He didn&#8217;t take that in. But
Joyce was riding away into the morning and facing the
awful facts that had called her from her work. Facing
the possibilities that might be ahead of her.</p>

<p>Suppose they had found Darcy and had the trial!
There had been time enough for that she supposed. Supposing
they had convicted him! But how could they when
it was all false? Still, if such things could be published
in the paper when they were not true, what might not
happen? Law was a strange thing. Would they have
hung him? Or electrocuted him? Did they do those
things so soon after the trial? The paper had spoken of
eye-witnesses. False witnesses of course. How could
they be true since the thing never happened? And what
was Gene doing in it all? The paper had spoken of Gene.
She hardly dared to get it out again and read it over lest
some one should read it over her shoulder. It seemed
so terrible to see Darcy&#8217;s name in such connection. Darcy
who had just given himself to Christ, who had made
over his life. And this to meet him at the outset. It was
enough to make some lose their faith. Not Darcy. Oh,
not Darcy! She cradled the thought of him like a child
in her prayers as the miles crept by and the morning
went on.</p>

<p>By and by the train stopped suddenly with a jerk and
a groan and after one or two attempts to creep a few steps,
lay there for a long time. She remembered dimly that
some such thing had happened on her way up. She wondered
idly if it were a part of every day&#8217;s journey? Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
impatience leaped ahead anxiously. Oh, if she were
only there!</p>

<p>At last the train started on again and suddenly she
realized that she must plan what she would do when she
got there. Should she go home and send for the police,
or should she go and try to find Darcy? She had no idea
where he lived now, and if he were at home he would
probably be in jail unless he had been able to prove that
he was innocent. Then suddenly she thought of Judge
Peterson. He would know what to do. He was a
judge. She would go straight to his house. Afterward
she would have to go home and explain her absence and
what she was doing, she supposed, but that could take
care of itself. She had Darcy now to think about.</p>

<p>She had hoped to get the noon train from the city
out to Meadow Brook, but when she reached her home
city her train was so late that there was no Meadow Brook
train till quarter of two. Then her impatience could wait
no longer and she called up Judge Peterson&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>At first she could get no answer, but just as she was
about to give up in despair a gruff voice said: &#8220;Hello!
Dan Peterson at the phone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Joyce in a relieved little voice. &#8220;Then
is the Judge there? I would like to speak to him a moment
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He isn&#8217;t here. He&#8217;s over at the court house.
Everybody&#8217;s over there. I just happened to run home
for some papers. Who is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Joyce Radway,&#8221; Joyce&#8217;s voice was all of a
tremble. What if she should be too late after all. What
if the trial was days ago?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;What! Joyce! Oh, <i>Glory</i>! Is that really you,
Joyce? Where are you? In town? Say, take the &#8216;L&#8217; and
I&#8217;ll meet you at Sixty-third Street with the car. You&#8217;re
wanted here, you certainly are. And say, you there yet?
Say, don&#8217;t talk to anybody on the way out! Mind that!
What&#8217;s that? In time? Oh, sure, the nick of time.
Couldn&#8217;t be better. All right. Get a hustle on. I&#8217;ll
meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce hung up the receiver and hurried out to the
elevated train, her heart beating high with hope.</p>

<p>Dan dashed out to his car and rattled over to the court
house, sent a note up to the Judge&#8217;s desk and waited by
the door. The message came up.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Say, Dad: The dead has come to life. Have her
here in half an hour. Where do you want me to bring
her? Here or over home?</p>

<p class="right">Dan.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The message came back with one word written across
the back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a light flashed from the eye of father to son as
Dan turned to dash out again.</p>

<p>Dan almost upset a small, forlorn figure pressed close
to the swinging, leathern doors, with woebegone look
and white, tear-stained cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello there, Kid, did I hurt you?&#8221; He paused in his
wild rush to set her on her feet again. &#8220;Why, little Lib
Knox, is this you?&#8221; he said tenderly, discovering her
identity and the tear streaks on her cheeks. &#8220;This is no
place for you, child. Come on, take a ride with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lib drew a sigh of sobbing and held back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;No, I gotta stay here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I gotta stay here
an&#8217; help my Uncle Darcy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, then an&#8217; we&#8217;ll help him.&#8221; He swept her
under one arm and marched away, she wearily resisting.
&#8220;Listen, Kid, I&#8217;ve got glad news. Wait till we sail an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll tell you who we&#8217;re goin&#8217; after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lib suddenly relaxed and looked in his face. There
was no mistaking the light in Dan&#8217;s eye. He had really
some glad news. Lib climbed into the machine and sat
back wearily, a poor little sinner with all her spirit gone,
and allowed herself to be led away from the scene of her
sorrow. Things had been going hard in there where
Uncle Darcy was with the bad red-haired man. She knew
it by the stern look on his face when the door swung
back and she got a glimpse. She knew it by the leer
on Tyke&#8217;s evil face, and by the smug exclamations of the
ladies who sat in the back seat and the knowing winks
of rough men near the door. She knew it by the hard
set of the old Judge&#8217;s mouth as he eyed the witnesses,
and by the way he worried them with questions now and
then like a cat with a mouse. If anything could be glad
now, Lib was ready to believe it.</p>

<p>When they had swung the second corner beyond the
court house Dan leaned down and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Lib, do you know who we&#8217;re going after?
Guess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God, I guess,&#8221; said Lib drearily. &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s
all&#8217;s could help my Uncle Darcy any. I heard the men
say he was as good as hung now!&#8221; She caught a sob
with a gulp and let the big tears roll down her worried
little face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>&#8220;Well, I guess God had something to do with it,&#8221;
allowed Dan comfortably. &#8220;He generally does. Cut
out that weeping, Lib. That&#8217;s not like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s all my fault!&#8221; she sobbed out, utterly broken
at last. &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;cause I went and took that ride with that
nasty red-haired man in his motor cycle. He&mdash;he&mdash;he
made me tell where Uncle Darcy was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how did you know where he was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I <i>didunt</i>!&#8221; wept Lib. &#8220;I made it up. I told
a <i>lie</i>. I said he was in Canada. And I told God it was
a lie, huh-huh-huh!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;But it didunt do
any good. God didn&#8217;t like it.&#8221; Dan put one arm around
her gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;There now, Lib, that&#8217;s all nonsense. You did a brave
thing and it didn&#8217;t have a thing to do with your uncle&#8217;s
trouble. It probably only held the man off a little longer.
Besides, there&#8217;s no need for you to worry any more.
Listen. Who do you think we&#8217;re going after? Joyce
Radway. She&#8217;s down at Sixty-third Street Station waiting
for us now. I just talked to her over the phone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lib Knox sat up as straight as a pipe stem and her
eyes got round and great behind their tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then He <i>did</i> hear!&#8221; she said in an awestruck tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God heard, away up in heaven like they said in
Sunday School. I didn&#8217;t believe it but now I do. But
I tried it anyway, and He heard. I ast Him would He
please bring her back to life again and He&#8217;s done it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan pressed the little hand he held and said huskily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Kid, He&#8217;s done it. I guess there was more
than one asking for that same thing. Well, here we are,
and&mdash;There she is!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> trial had been going hard with Darcy, as little
Lib had surmised. Even the old Judge had been crabbed
in some of his orders, and thrown anxious glances
among the witnesses searching in vain for some ray of
hope. He loved Darcy and things seemed to be going
against him.</p>

<p>Not for one minute in his heart of hearts did Judge
Peterson believe that Darcy Sherwood was guilty of such
things as he was being charged with, and when he stood
up straight and handsome in the prisoner&#8217;s box to answer
to the question: &#8220;Guilty or not Guilty?&#8221; he had admired
the straight, clear look with which he faced the roomful
of curious enemies and anxious friends. Slowly Darcy
had swept the room with his glance as if searching for
one on whom he could rely. Anxiously his eyes rested
on his sister Ellen, sitting huddled behind her handkerchief,
and on the little shrinking Lib, looking so fierce
beside her, surprisedly on the minister and his wife, taking
in their kindly faces, something true and real about
them. He knew they were Joyce&#8217;s friends and he liked
their being there. There was nothing hostile about them.
Then his gaze wandered to the four men huddled together
in a corner with Tyke spreading himself as their leader,
making loud mouthed remarks and casting furtive, sidelong
glances, keeping his eyes away from the prisoner. Darcy
took them in half amusedly, wholly comprehending, almost
a smile of contempt flitting across his face, before
he turned deliberately and faced his enemy, Gene, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
looked him keenly down with a cold, righteous glance.
Then he turned back to the Judge and said quietly, &#8220;Not
Guilty, Your Honor,&#8221; as if there had been no pause
between the question and the answer. The Judge found
himself watching the boy and wondering where he got his
poise, his cool calm look, that might almost be described
as that of peace.</p>

<p>From the start Darcy sat in his place and watched each
actor in the little scene before him as if he were somehow
outside of it all, detached from the whole thing, as if the
outcome were of little moment to him, only the persons.</p>

<p>Darcy had not asked for a lawyer. In fact, he had
refused one. He would not ask anybody to help him, nor
tell anything that would give a clue to where he had
been or what he had been doing. He had told them he
would plead his own cause when the time came.</p>

<p>So the evidence went on. Witnesses were sworn in
and testified to the most unpleasant details in a well constructed
tale of horror. Tyke was clever, but Bill was
sharp, and what the two of them could not think out the
canny Cottar did. They had left no question unprepared
for, no weak places in their line of evidence. They even
had an old flashlight of Darcy&#8217;s they had found where
he had left it last at one of their meeting places, and
most carefully had they preserved it without handling
that the finger prints might be observed. Obligingly
Darcy put out his fingers for the impression, that smile
of half amusement on his lips. So well he understood the
revenge that was working all this elaborate network of
lies to catch him.</p>

<p>Yet as the evidence went on he began to realize how
cleverly it had been done, and how only a miracle of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
kind could save him. He sat gravely watching it all,
listening. Now and then jotting down a note for his own
reply when his time came, but for the most part, gravely
listening, and the day went on and blacker grew the evidence
against him. The excitement in the court-room was
great. There were not wanting gruesome details and
Darcy&#8217;s face grew stern and his soul sick within him. To
think that Joyce should, through him, be mixed up in
a loathsome mess like this! He would rather have died
a thousand deaths than to have had her name connected
in such wise.</p>

<p>The spectators were strained to the highest point. Nan,
heavily veiled and weeping, was most affected. When it
came her turn to testify she told of the beautiful relation
between herself and Joyce, but said that Joyce was very
secretive and went out a good deal evenings, staying late.
Once during Bill&#8217;s blunt testimony she screamed and
fainted and had to be taken out, but insisted on coming
back again. And hourly the look of suffering grew on
Darcy&#8217;s face, as if the ordeal were actual physical pain.
But once, there was a little relaxing of the strain, when
old Noah Casey took the stand, and was asked to swear
that he would tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth.</p>

<p>He climbed into his place and laid a trembling, knotted
hand upon the book, but when they asked him to swear
he smiled about upon them and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother taught me not to swear,&#8221; he said serenely,
while the four who were sponsoring him frowned and
cursed beneath their breath.</p>

<p>He stood there looking about on the throng, his quick
bright eyes travelling from one face to another, half suspicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
of them all, half frightened like a wild thing of
the woods. And when the people laughed he laughed with
them at himself. The difficulty about the oath over, he
told his story, eagerly, somewhat like a child, in short
hurried sentences, his bright eyes still hurrying over the
audience, his long nervous fingers fingering the brim
of his old felt hat. &#8220;I was going acrost the medder&mdash;&#8221; he
began, &#8220;ahint of the graveyard&mdash;&#8221; and Gene&#8217;s lawyer
helped him out with questions. &#8220;You saw a bundle on
the ground like a human body&mdash;&#8221; the bright eyes focused
on the lawyer an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it was broken glass. Leastways that&#8217;s what I
thought I saw. They tell me&mdash;&#8221; The lawyer hurried
into another question, and the Judge interrupted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you look around, Noah, and tell me if
you can see the man you saw that night digging in the
graveyard?&#8221;</p>

<p>The bright eyes focused on the Judge, and then
turned quickly toward Tyke. The lawyer hastened with
his assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it this man, Noah?&#8221; he pointed to the prisoner.</p>

<p>Noah Casey turned around toward the box where
Darcy sat and saw Darcy for the first time:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! <i>Him?</i>&#8221; he asked, pointing with a long finger
at Darcy who regarded him with a grin of friendliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, that&#8217;s Darcy Sherwood. I know <i>him</i>. I&#8217;ve
knowed him since he was a little tad. Oh, no, it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
Darcy. <i>He&#8217;s</i> a good boy. He wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing.
The man I saw had red ha&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gene&#8217;s lawyer raised his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Honor, I am disappointed in this witness.
Mentally he does not seem to be quite all that I supposed&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>&#8220;Undoubtedly&mdash;&#8221; said the Judge under his breath,
and Noah was hustled off the scene.</p>

<p>But the afternoon came on and somehow the false
witnesses were making a pretty good case of it against
Darcy. The Judge&#8217;s eyebrows were drawn in a heavy
frown and his breath came quick and deep. Those who
knew him well knew that he was troubled, and it was just
then that Dan&#8217;s note was handed up.</p>

<p>No one but Darcy noticed the twinkle that came in
the Judge&#8217;s eyes, and he wondered and tried to puzzle it
out. The Judge was his friend he knew, and wanted to
see him cleared, but surely all hope was gone. The evidence
was all on one side. Why prolong the agony? It
almost seemed as if the Judge were trying to keep the
case going, trying to make time. He asked the most
trivial questions and tripped up the lawyer again and
again, holding a witness far beyond necessity.</p>

<p>All at once the Judge drew a long breath and a light
came in his eye. He sat back as if he were done, and
ordered that the prisoner be allowed to speak for himself.</p>

<p>The leather door at the back of the court-room had
swung noiselessly but that moment, and little Lib had
entered, straight and beaming, and behind her walked a
lady, and Dan Peterson. Darcy gave one glance and
then arose, and there was a new light in his face. It was
almost as if he had come to a triumphant moment, instead
of being about to plead for his life in the face of indubitable
evidence against him. Those who were watching
noticed with a shock that he actually had a kind of smile
on his face, and a look of something&mdash;could it be peace?
What utter nonsense! Perhaps he was going out of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
mind. Any one might, having to listen to such a list of
his own horrible crimes!</p>

<p>But Darcy was speaking in his quiet tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;It almost seems a pity to add anything after such
well established evidence as you all have heard. If I didn&#8217;t
know I wasn&#8217;t guilty I would almost think I was after
listening to what has been said. So I won&#8217;t try to argue
in my own favor. I see Miss Joyce Radway herself has
just come in, and I&#8217;m going to ask if she may come up
here and tell you whether I ever abducted her, or murdered
her, or buried her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then indeed there was a great stir in the court-room.
People stretched their necks to see, and rose up in their
seats, but the Judge commanded silence. Under cover of
the confusion Tyke attempted an escape, but was stopped
by order of the watchful Judge.</p>

<p>Joyce came to the front of the room, proudly escorted
by Lib who held her hand to the very witness stand and
then stood by with glad eyes to watch her.</p>

<p>Joyce turned and faced the excited throng, then looking
toward her old friend, Judge Peterson, she spoke in
clear, ringing tones that everybody could hear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Honor, I haven&#8217;t seen Mr. Sherwood but once
since I left home a year ago to go to Silverton and teach.
Mr. Sherwood does not know I saw him then. He was
making a speech in a religious service in the city where
I happened to be one evening, and it was a good speech
too. I wish you could have heard it. I tried to get up
to speak to him but the crowd was so great that he was
gone before I got to the platform.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her face toward the court-room a little
more, looking down at the seats where the witnesses sat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
and noticing with startled eyes the man of the loud voice
who had addressed her as &#8220;girlie&#8221; on that memorable
morning one year ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you have been trying to do to
my old friend, Mr. Sherwood, or where you got such
utter lies. I went away from Meadow Brook because I
wanted to teach and I knew my relatives were opposed
to my doing it. I did not realize that I could be misunderstood
or make trouble for anybody by doing so, but my
going certainly had nothing whatever to do with Darcy
Sherwood. We have seldom seen each other since we were
school children together, and he has always been most
kind and gentlemanly to me whenever I have met him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I happened to see an old copy of the <i>Meadow Brook
News</i> this morning and read to my horror what you were
saying about him and me. It made me sick that my old
friends and my relatives could allow such an awful charge
to be made on such a man as Darcy Sherwood. I had to
get somebody to take my place in school while I came
here, and I was afraid I wouldn&#8217;t get here in time before
you did something dreadful you could never be forgiven
for. But I&#8217;m glad I came, and I&#8217;m&mdash;<i>ashamed</i> of you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>If any one had been looking at Darcy then they would
have seen a wonderful look in his eyes, but everybody&#8217;s
attention was centred on Joyce. There had not been such
a sensation in Meadow Brook in years as the dead coming
to life just in time to save a tragedy.</p>

<p>The Judge stood up and addressed Darcy. His voice
was trembling. He was very unjudgelike in his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, you are free from the charge and the court
dismisses the case.&#8221; He was smiling and there was something
like a mist in his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>Darcy inclined his head slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Honor, I thank you. I am glad to be exonerated
from a crime that I did not commit; but I want to ask
your permission now to confess to one that I did. I want
to take the penalty, whatever it is, and be cleared in the
eyes of the law forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The court-room grew suddenly hushed. People who
had risen and begun to adjust wraps and pick up their
gloves sat down again. All ears were strained to hear
every word.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my permission,&#8221; said the Judge looking
instantly grave and anxious. &#8220;Is the attorney here to take
down the confession? Mr. Robinson&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little stir in the room while the attorney
came forward, and then Darcy went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;For several months prior to the time last spring when
I left town I had been in the bootlegging business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&mdash;Ah!&#8221; were whispered here and there with
nods of previous conviction from people who had been
half disappointed to have the trial turn out so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave it up because I had come to feel that it was
wrong. I confess it now because I want to pay the penalty
of what I have done. Judge, I will be glad if you will put
this through as soon as possible. I am ready to take
what is coming to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge bowed gravely. There was no denying
that he looked relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will have to go through the regular routine of
course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it can be run through quickly. Mr.
Robinson, you get the items, number of cases sold and
so on; prepare the indictment, and we&#8217;ll try to get it
through tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>The Judge straightened up and looked about him, his
eyes resting on the four witnesses, holding their hats ready
for a speedy departure, and at that moment the district
attorney jumped up briskly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Honor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I ask that these four witnesses
be held for perjury.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur of satisfaction went rippling over the court-room
as people rose to go out.</p>

<p>People were rushing around Joyce as she came out,
still escorted by little Lib, proud as a small peacock. Nan
was the first to envelop her in a smothering embrace,
weeping copiously upon her neck with loud show of affection.
Many old friends lingered, waiting just to watch
her dear face alight with the relief and triumph of the
moment. The minister and his wife were close behind
Joyce and eagerly asked her to come home with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; put in Nan decidedly, &#8220;She&#8217;s coming to her
<i>own</i> home of course. Everything in your room is just
as you left it, <i>darling</i>&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce couldn&#8217;t help smiling at the affectionate appellative.</p>

<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake get rid of that awful child, and come
on,&#8221; whispered Nan loudly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let her hang on you
like that. Let&#8217;s get out of this terrible crowd! How
curious people are! Come on home!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor little Lib dropped Joyce&#8217;s arm as if she had
been shot, but Joyce quickly caught the little cold hand
and drew it back close within her arm, her own warm
fingers keeping the little hand clasped tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want her here, Nan. She is my dear little friend,&#8221;
said Joyce pleasantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake! You always had such queer
friends, Joyce,&#8221; she laughed disagreeably. &#8220;Well, never
mind, bring her along, only come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dan Peterson&#8217;s hand was on Joyce&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mrs. Massey, Joyce is coming with us. Father
wants to see her right away at home,&#8221; and off he carried
Joyce and Lib in his own big shiny car, while Nan tried
to hide her chagrin by taking to herself reflected glory,
and trying to make a little social hay while the sun shone.</p>

<p>Joyce went home with the Petersons and was presently
sitting in Judge Peterson&#8217;s library, learning about her
inheritance, and being prepared for the reading of the will
which was to come after supper as soon as the Masseys
could be summoned to the hearing.</p>

<p>But all the time her mind was on the listen, and she
was hoping that Darcy would come. Surely, surely he
would come and speak to her, just thank her or something.
He had been busy with the attorney when she left the
court-room, and had flashed her just one gorgeous smile
as she looked back at him. Had she been mistaken?
Surely there was a promise in that glance, that he would
see her again. She wondered why everything seemed to
have suddenly gone so flat. She ought to go back of
course on the night train and be ready to teach on the
morrow, but her heart was not willing to go&mdash;not yet&mdash;and
Judge Peterson presently settled the matter by saying
that she would be needed the next day for the technicalities
of the settlement of the estate.</p>

<p>So she sent a telegram to Harrington:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Will be back to teach Monday morning. Cannot
possibly come sooner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> will was read at last.</p>

<p>Gene and Nan, glowering in the corner of Judge
Peterson&#8217;s comfortable library, learned with dismay that
their part was only a small patrimony which Mary Massey
had in her own right. The rest, house, and meadow
lands, and money enough to keep her comfortably were
all Joyce&#8217;s left her by her mother from her own
father&#8217;s estate.</p>

<p>It had been her mother&#8217;s wish that Joyce should not
know that she had anything but herself to depend upon
until she grew up. She felt that so she would the better
come up unspoiled and independent. So she had placed
the property in her sister&#8217;s hands in such a way that
unless Mary Massey died Joyce would not know that
she had anything until she came of age. Judge Peterson
was the other trustee of the property and was to use his
own discretion about telling Joyce in case of her aunt&#8217;s
death before her majority. But during the interval of
Joyce&#8217;s absence from Meadow Brook Joyce had come to
her majority, so there was no longer any hindrance to her
entering into her inheritance at once.</p>

<p>Mary Massey had not told her son the whole thing
for reasons of her own, but she had left a letter explaining
the matter to him, and reminding him of what she had
always told him, that she had very little to leave him,
but commending Joyce to his tender care, and saying
she had little fear but that Joyce would always be generous
with him.</p>

<p>Gene and Nan arose silently when the business of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
will was concluded. They had a look of withdrawing.
A hurt, stricken look.</p>

<p>Joyce sprang up and went over to them, saying eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Gene, you&#8217;ll stay in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your house,&#8221; said Gene. &#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll get
right out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Joyce earnestly. &#8220;At least not
unless you don&#8217;t want to stay, of course. The house was
your mother&#8217;s home. All these technicalities of law don&#8217;t
change the matter a mite to me. I know Aunt Mary expected
us all to live there, and she knew I would say so.
Even though it is mine it&#8217;s just the same as yours. Besides,
I&#8217;ve another little house of my own in Silverton and I
presume I shall go back there and go on teaching. I
should not be happy doing nothing. The house may have
been bought by my father&#8217;s money, but it was made into
a home by your mother&#8217;s loving care, and it&#8217;s yours as
much as it is mine. As long as you live I want you to feel
you can live in it if you want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could sell it,&#8221; said Gene, still independently,
&#8220;or rent it. I will pay you rent,&#8221; stiffly.</p>

<p>Joyce laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. You won&#8217;t pay me rent. If you try
to I&#8217;ll pay you for your mother&#8217;s love and care. How
would that be? And I don&#8217;t want to sell the house. I love
it. I like to think it&#8217;s there for me to come home to now and
then. And Nan, you don&#8217;t need to feel hampered there.
You can arrange things just as you like, just as if it
were your own. Just treat me like a sister, that&#8217;s all,
and share with me in what there is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s very generous in you, Joyce,&#8221; said
Gene, feeling a sense of shame over the way he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
always treated her. &#8220;We&#8217;ll think about it. Aren&#8217;t you
coming home with us now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll be down tomorrow, I guess,&#8221; she said
pleasantly. &#8220;I want to get all these papers signed and
everything fixed. I must be back on my job Monday,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have to teach now,&#8221; said Nan,
an envious note in her voice. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just telegraph
them you aren&#8217;t coming back, and quit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that wouldn&#8217;t be honorable,&#8221; laughed Joyce.
&#8220;And besides I like it. I wouldn&#8217;t leave the kiddies for
anything till the term is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer girl,&#8221; said Nan speculatively. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see why you don&#8217;t just want to have a good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m having a beautiful time,&#8221; said Joyce, wide-eyed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;ve always wanted to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went home, and the evening passed and still
Darcy did not come. Joyce began to wonder if he were
not coming at all. If, perhaps, she might be going to have
to write him a note or call him up or something; for she
did not mean to go back to Silverton without telling him
in so many words how glad she was that he had found
her Lord.</p>

<p>Joyce spent Friday in going over her things in the
old home and packing up what she wanted to take back
with her to Silverton, but she went back at night to Judge
Peterson&#8217;s. The minister and his wife came in to call
that evening and they had a beautiful talk, but all the time
Joyce was listening for a step that did not come, and wondering.
Was Darcy still shy? Surely he would come
just once after all that had happened, after she had come
home to make things straight and set him free.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>She thought she heard the minister speak his name
as they were about to leave, talking to Dan Peterson over
by the door, and Dan said, &#8220;Yes, tomorrow,&#8221; that was
all. She wanted to ask, but something held her back, and
no one mentioned Darcy. Was it his second trial that
was coming off tomorrow she wondered?</p>

<p>She did not sleep well that night. She kept waking
and thinking of Darcy. Was he going to have to go to
prison after all for bootlegging? It seemed so hard now
that he had begun his new life. She wished she dared ask
about the law.</p>

<p>The next morning at the breakfast table she followed
a sudden impulse and told the Judge and his wife all
about Darcy&#8217;s speech in the meeting on the night of the
rain. Dan had gone into the hall to answer the telephone
and when he came back he tiptoed in and stood by the
door quietly, as if some one were praying. His eyes were
down and his face looked strangely tender as if he were
hearing a miracle. Neither the Judge nor Dan were much
on religion, but Mrs. Peterson was a saint if there was
one, and her face glowed with joy over the story. The
old Judge cleared his throat three times before he growled
out the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Darcy&#8217;s all right, Darcy&#8217;s all right.&#8221; His glasses
seemed to be blurred and he had to take them off and
polish them before he could see right again. &#8220;He needn&#8217;t
have confessed that at all. It was all over and forgot.
But still, I like him better for it. Great stuff in him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Joyce summoned courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he have trouble again, with this other trial?
What will be the penalty? Will he have to go to prison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, oh, no! Nothing like that,&#8221; said the Judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
hastily. &#8220;Oh, no, he&#8217;ll just have to pay a penalty. Probably
about five hundred dollars or something like that,
according to the amount of stuff handled. Know how
much it was, Dan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About,&#8221; said Dan gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great boy, Darcy!&#8221; said the Judge emphatically.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right this morning. Case comes off before
noon, doesn&#8217;t it, Dan? Where&#8217;s my note book?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, before noon,&#8221; said Dan, and then they both
went out and Joyce, with relieved heart, went to singing
and playing on the old tinpanny, yellow-keyed square piano,
singing with all her heart, the song they sang that night
in the meeting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Free from the law, O sinner, receive it,</div>
<div class="verse">Free from the law, O brother, believe it&mdash;!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and Mrs. Peterson, up in her room making her bed and
plumping up the pillows, said to herself happily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless her dear little heart. I wish we could keep
her here.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Darcy came home with Judge Peterson at noon to
lunch. He seemed a new Darcy. His face was alight,
and his smile was joyous.</p>

<p>He did not talk much during the meal, but what he
said rippled with humor, and kept them all in gales of
laughter. The new gravity that was upon him when he
was silent sat well there, and gave him an air of one who
had found a solid foundation.</p>

<p>As they arose from the table he looked at Joyce and
said in a tone that every one could hear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Joyce, it&#8217;s a gorgeous afternoon and I thought
perhaps you&#8217;d like to take a walk through some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
the old paths. I have something I&#8217;d like to tell you,
and if you don&#8217;t mind being seen in company with a law-breaker
like me we might stroll down to the old woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce looked up with her face flooded with glory:
&#8220;Oh, but you&#8217;re not under the law now, you know,&#8221; she
said brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not in any sense, thank the Lord,&#8221; said Darcy
reverently. &#8220;Not even under the law of the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked down the long, smooth road together
past the bridge and round the turn, and there on the hill
before them lay the woods in all the beauty of the springtime
verdure. They had been talking of the trial, Darcy
telling her all that had gone on before she arrived, and
also of the second trial where he had paid the fine and
been set free. But now, at the turn of the road, they
stopped and looked. The scene was so lovely, one could
but exclaim at the beauty of the hillside. The fields were
green and dotted with violets where they walked, and all
about were spicy odors of the spring, with exquisite perfumes
in the making. Before them rose the woods, pale
greens stippled with red buds on their tips, and a background
of darker pines. And now they spoke of Aunt
Mary and the day they had spent together.</p>

<p>As they entered the woods frail anemones scattered
their pathway, and hepaticas, blue and white, met them
in groups where maiden hair hid, and little curled fern
fronds stuck up through the black mould. As they walked
down that pine-strewn path, flower broidered and dim, each
was conscious of the last time they had passed that way.
They had gone out from that arched silence a boy and
girl, they were re&euml;ntering man and woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>For a few moments neither spoke. Then Darcy, as
if he were treading holy ground:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was here you sat when I first saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce flashed him a golden look.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you there?&#8221; she pointed. &#8220;I have always
wanted to go there and sit myself,&#8221; she said, &#8220;with my
feet hanging over that rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; he said, and caught her hand.</p>

<p>He helped her down to a comfortable spot, where
the mossy rock shelved over the water, and the little brook
babbled over bright stones in a quiet, musical way.</p>

<p>Sitting there he told her of the deep experience of his
heart. Of how that day and the story of the blind man
had lingered with him all those years, until he came to
understand that he was blind, and he was a sinner and
needed a Saviour. He told her how her eyes had pierced
his soul, like the thought of God searching him, and how
he had finally surrendered. He spoke of the peace and
joy that were his now, and of his Bible.</p>

<p>And then Joyce told him how she had come in out of
the rain and heard him talking, and tried to reach him
and failed.</p>

<p>The sun dropped lower in the west and the long shadows
came within their sweet retreat. Finally, they sat
in silence, just listening to the birds, and the tinkle of
the water, feeling how good it was to be here after
the years.</p>

<p>Suddenly Darcy began to speak again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce, I&#8217;m going to tell you something. You may
think perhaps I oughtn&#8217;t to tell you, that I have no right
to speak of such things&mdash;that I am unworthy. But somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
I think you ought to know. After I&#8217;ve told you
I&#8217;m not going to presume upon it. I know as well as
you do that I&#8217;m unworthy. But I&#8217;ve loved you all my life,
and it&#8217;s kept me from a great deal that I might have done
if I hadn&#8217;t. I never dreamed of you as mine, not in any
material sense of the word. I always knew I wasn&#8217;t big
enough and good enough for you, but I&#8217;ve kept you like
a shrine in a temple, a place to worship at. You can&#8217;t
know what it&#8217;s meant to me. I&#8217;m telling you this because
it&#8217;s the only way I can thank you for what you did for
me. You saved my life, and I want you to know that
all that a man has to give a woman, that I have given to
you. There will never be any other girl for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Joyce&#8217;s head was turned away. She was trying
to keep the blinding joy of her heart from leaping to
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you refuse to let me give anything back to
you?&#8221; she asked in a little faltering voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Joyce?&#8221; He lifted his eyes
and looked at her anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, does it mean nothing to you that I have
loved you too, ever since the day we were here last?&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joyce! Do you mean that? You loved me all that
time? But of course you did not know me, did not
know that I was&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I loved <i>you</i>,&#8221; said Joyce firmly. &#8220;And I love you
now. I didn&#8217;t know it was that when I came home to
save you, but I guess it was there all the time only I hadn&#8217;t
told myself about it&mdash;yet&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Joyce, my darling!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>He gathered her close to his heart and closed his eyes
in an ecstasy of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me feel so humble!&#8221; he said at last looking
into her eyes. &#8220;To think that I, a sinner, a law-breaker&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her fingers on his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For ye are not under the law,&#8217;&#8221; she quoted softly,
&#8220;&#8216;but under grace.&#8217; Have you forgotten that He puts His
righteousness upon us?&#8221;</p>

<p>They came back from their walk in the twilight with
the stars looking down upon them and a new moon shining
in a clear sky, but they did not see it. They were
walking hand in hand and talking of many precious things.</p>

<p>The Petersons had been waiting dinner for them
almost an hour, but they were serenely unconscious of
the fact.</p>

<p>They went to church the next day and sat in the old
Peterson pew, side by side, with the Judge and Mrs.
Peterson and Dan, for the delectation of all eyes, but they
didn&#8217;t know that either. They were as happy as any two
people could be in this world.</p>

<p>Monday morning, with the first ray of light, Darcy
was up and at his car, and before the people of Meadow
Brook had begun to think about waking up he and Joyce
were on their way to Silverton. Joyce had around her
shoulders her gray fox neckpiece. Nan had ostentatiously
thrown it out the window in the gray of the morning
when they stopped there for Joyce&#8217;s trunk saying: &#8220;Here,
Joyce, you&#8217;ll need this. It&#8217;s chilly. I had it put carefully
away for you in camphor all winter.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>They had the road to themselves for the first two hours
and Darcy&#8217;s racing engine flew out along the road as
smoothly as perfect steel and well oiled bearings could make
it. They drove into Silverton at ten minutes to eight, and
went straight to Joyce&#8217;s little house to leave her trunk,
much to the wonder and delight of Mrs. Bryant who hadn&#8217;t
known what to make of Joyce&#8217;s absence.</p>

<p>Joyce was wearing on her finger a splendid diamond.
Darcy had routed a jeweller friend out of bed late Saturday
night to get it, and paid for it with a check that almost
cleaned his bank account out entirely, but he wore
a look on his face of utter happiness.</p>

<p>They drove up to the school house five minutes before
the bell rang, and Professor Harrington stood on the
steps talking to a teacher. Joyce was still in her new
spring suit and pretty, becoming little hat, with the gray
fox around her neck, and Harrington felt his resolve
slowly melting away from him. How could one be cold
to a girl who looked like that? She certainly was stunning
in those clothes. He had thought all along that clothes
would make a big difference. But who the deuce was the
big, good-looking giant who brought her.</p>

<p>And then the giant stooped and kissed Joyce, and he
frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that your brother?&#8221; he asked as Joyce came
flying up the walk afraid she was going to be late.</p>

<p>Joyce lifted a saucy face and smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Harrington,&#8221; she said sweetly. &#8220;That is
the man I am going to marry. Have you time to come
down and meet him?&#8221;</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project

edition.
